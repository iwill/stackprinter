              To explain the humor, its easy to forget you do not normally have the privilege to do things like mount a new drive or use a package manager to install new programs. My console sessions always look like &quot;mount somedrive&quot; &quot;[You must be a superuser to do that]&quot; &quot;sudo mount somedrive&quot; &quot;[done]&quot; - <b> Jimmy</b>

              In early versions of Minesweeper, you could pause the game by hitting Esc - the window would minimize and the clock pause. In Windows 2000 the clock would stop but the window would remain, so you could play out the game and your time would be whatever the clock said right now. It was obviously a bug but Microsoft documented it as if it was a feature. - <b> Hugh Allen</b>

              In 1976 I was the most junior programmer on a project (early email system) and so was relegated to testing. The &#39;testing book&#39; went on for 150 pages (something like that) and, since it was across a network (Tymnet) the only way they knew to do it was to run each test manually and record the results. I had to do the whole book once per week. So I wrote a program that captured my keystrokes and the resultant output, then another that reran the keystrokes and looked for any changes in the output. Instant regression testing that took about 5 minutes to run. And my boss was pissed. Go figure. - <b> Peter Rowell</b>

              @tuinstoel no it does not. For those that don&#39;t get it yet that&#39;s just sad; call yourself programmers. The aliens have four fingers and therefore they count by saying 1 2 3 10 we count by saying 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 so for both of us we percieve that we both use base &#39;10&#39; but 10(alien) != 10(human) --&gt; 10(alien) == 4(human). I hope that makes more sense to everyone. Sorry for those who got it but i felt the desperate need to explain the wrong logic some people seem to have. - <b> Robert Massaioli</b>

              Well, if you restrict the depth of the expressions to something reasonably large, the automaton can handle it. I remember Martin Kay telling us in one class that he spent half a year of his life on converting CFGs into limited-depth FSAs. - <b> Torsten Marek</b>

              But you can never handle arbitrary expressions of that type with a FSA as you essentially have to construct a different FSA for each and every possible case of the problem.

On a seperate note, does anyone know WHERE this comes from? Found on a random-image thread, but I never knoew the source. - <b> xan</b>

              Yeah, this comic is pretty moronic.  Take away the specific technology (in this case, .NET) and it&#39;s like a third-rate slashdot comment from 1999.  &quot;Hur hur our technology is better.&quot; But the worst part is the fact that the technological jargon they spout isn&#39;t even impressive.  Moving code between web apps and desktops? Separating database code and logic (which is what a DAL is)? who cares? And it&#39;s not like VB is a paragon of type saftey. - <b> Chad Okere</b>

<p>This strip first appeared on Sept 17, 1995, back in the days when 28.8K modems, a 66Mhz 486DX, and a soundblaster card were state-of-the-art.</p>
<p>I worked for a start-up called Telebackup at the time and guess what we were trying to develop?  Scott Adams must have sat in on one of the management/developer meetings.</p>

              Even worse if they make a &quot;screen capture&quot; with a digital camera.  I&#39;ve had that happen more than once.  Also, if there is a bug/issue tracker involved, they may opt to merely give the path to the word2007 doc instead, yep, with a path like c:\documents and settings....

                <p>Ten reasons you know you're living in 2009 </p>
<ol>
<li>You accidentally enter your password on the microwave. </li>
<li>You haven't played solitaire with real cards in years. </li>
<li>You have a list of 15 phone numbers to reach your family of 3. </li>
<li>You e-mail the person who works at the desk next to you. </li>
<li>Your reason for not staying in touch with friends and family is that they don't have e-mail addresses. </li>
<li>You pull up in your own driveway and use your cell phone to see if anyone is home. </li>
<li>Every commercial on television has a web site at the bottom of the screen. </li>
<li>Leaving the house without your cell phone, which you didn't have the first 20 or 30 (or 60) years of your life, is now a cause for panic and you turn around to go and get it. </li>
