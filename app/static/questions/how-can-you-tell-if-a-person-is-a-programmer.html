Programmer Habits
</a>
<sup style="font-size:9px">[1]</sup>" thread, I was wondering: Is there any way to tell if somebody is a programmer without actually asking them?  </p>
<hr />
<p><em>Clarification</em>: I am asking for things that you can use to recognise a programmer from "afar" or without knowing them well. To identify habits, you need to be around a person for a certain amount of time.</p>

              I did this long before I started programming. Sometimes I was serious, and sometimes it was for humorous effect. Also, when I was in English class in high school and had to use a vocabulary word in a sentence, I would make the sentence as long as possible, with lots of irrelevant back story and asides. So I guess the moral is that dorks do this, and programmers are a subclass of dorks. :) - <b> Nathan Long</b>

              I&#39;m fairly sure that for writing, if nested parentheses are necessary, you are supposed to alternate between parentheses and square brackets (just as for nested quotes, you are supposed to alternate between double and single quotes).

              It&#39;s quite possible to store simple routines in your answer buffer and have them called when a social interrupt occurs. My own is basically a &quot;SYN/ACK&quot;-type response which reflects salutations and valedictions (e.g. &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; with &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;, &quot;have a nice day&quot; with &quot;you, too&quot;). Of course, the one bug I haven&#39;t been able to eliminate is &quot;Happy Birthday&quot;. The response is emitted before I can catch the exception. :-) - <b> Ben Blank</b>

<p>A woman asks her husband, a programmer, to go shopping:
<br />- Dear, please, go to the nearby grocery store to buy some bread. Also, if they have eggs, buy 6.
<br />- O.K., hun.
Twenty minutes later the husband comes back bringing 6 loaves of bread. His wife is flabbergasted:

              This is his parsing error based on lack of context-sensitive prediction. If he was a smart programmer, he would have correctly assessed the probability that the second sentence was a separate statement. &quot;they&quot; should have been a variable referenced as &quot;grocery store&quot; while buy 6 should refer to eggs, not to bread (bread already has the clause &quot;buy some&quot; next to it). - <b> Unknown</b>

              The wife&#39;s question is so redundant. Buy 6 eggs would be enough, as this would lead to the husband buying 6 eggs - if available. If there aren&#39;t any eggs, he can&#39;t buy them, so the &quot;if they have&quot; condition is redundant. - <b> Dave</b>

              You only need to slash your zeros if they might be confused with the letter o in that context.  You never need to slash the zed if you write it carefully because it never looks like a two if you write it carefully.

              @MasterPeter - that is the technically correct way to punctuate a sentence ending with a parenthetical. I hate it too, and I deliberately do it wrong because it makes more sense, but every time I do it I cringe a little as my brain resolves the conflict between technically correct and logically consistent. - <b> Chris Lutz</b>

              This is only correct IN ENGLISH.  Most other western languages do not have this brain damage.  Note also that this typographic convention is losing popularity, since it is now quite easy to move the period close enough to the close parenthesis to look good.  - <b> TokenMacGuy</b>

              &quot;The Elements of Typographic Style&quot; By Robert Bringhurst, is THE cannonical source of &quot;correct&quot; typographical rules.  It says to put the punctuation on the (outside).  There&#39;s a ton of rules like this that came about from the use of TYPEWRITERS, that are still hanging around, causing havoc.

              I&#39;m afraid that the people who say this is the correct way are confusing the last rule in page 5 with the first in page 6 in <a href="http://www.newcastle.edu.au/unit/ctl/lsp/documents/punctuation_and_sentences.pdf" rel="nofollow">newcastle.edu.au/unit/ctl/lsp/documents/&hellip;</a> . The relevant one (the latter) says: &quot;Place end stop punctuation marks according to logic. If a parenthesis is part of the sentence, then the full stop comes outside the bracket. e.g. It was the quickest way out (and the most dangerous).&quot; - <b> Daniel Daranas</b>

              It&#39;s not the correct way, as Jeff Davis and numerous others pointed out.

              I go crazy over this, since I&#39;m a typography geek, and typographically, it looks better to include a period or comma inside quote marks. But semantically, the period or comma often belongs outside of the quote marks, and in many cases when discussing technical matters, it is necessary to put it outside in order to avoid ambiguity. So I will frequently start writing with punctuation inside quotes, then realize it&#39;s not clear in one case, then go back and edit all of my quotations in the document to match that one case. Grr. Parenthesis, though, always follow the logical structure. - <b> Brian Campbell</b>

              @ Lasse V. Karlsen : Kilo has always meant 1000. You can&#39;t just make SI units mean something else, not matter what field you are in. Blaming harddrive manufacturers is a cop-out. The blame should be placed on sloppy computer engineers. - <b> Mads Elvheim</b>

              Oh, the same thing could be said regarding engineers and mathematicians who forget to specify which logarithm they use in their papers. Is &quot;log&quot; log2? log10? The natural logarithm? It&#39;s awfully annoying. - <b> Mads Elvheim</b>

                <p>They attempt to unwind the call stack in a conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>
<p>The responses where people are indicating that this frustrates/horrifies non-programmers are pretty interesting to me.  It seems like having to have a mental model of the call stack and execution state of each stack frame helps in being able to juggle multiple discourse-threads in the same conversation.</p>

              Alternatively: you can tell a programmer if they get really agitated when they are <i>not</i> given the chance to complete calls that are on the stack. I have a colleague who asks me for help on a programming issue; starts describing what&#39;s going on; interrupts himself to start a new sentence, leaving me hanging; does this 3 or so levels deep; and never goes back to finish previous sentences. Drives me bonkers. - <b> LarsH</b>

The most successful ISA in the history is probably the ARM architecture. Sales of ARM processors are an order of magnitude larger than for x86. You probably own at least 10 ARM processors - one in your cell phone, one in your digital camera, at least one in your TV set, a few more in your car, etc... - <b> slacker</b>

              You could probably argue that most programming constructs are terrible and dangerous, because there&#39;s a lot of people programming who have no idea what they are doing, and who will manage to screw it up, and make a complete mess of things.  That doesn&#39;t mean we should do away with these features. - <b> Kibbee</b>

              I was trying to remember who said it (maybe Knuth?) but it went something like &quot;Goto is useful for when you need to get somewhere&quot;. Some languages like VB6 and friends don&#39;t have a way to get of of deeply nested loops you can only break out of the current loop, test for the exit condition in the next level, break out, test, repeat... Or you can just goto. That said, avoiding goto has often forced my to rethink what I am doing and thus saved me from writing some poorly structured code.  - <b> Oorang</b>

              @faceless1_14:  While true in the grammar books, this is not true in practice.  Using &quot;he&quot; or &quot;him&quot; will strongly bias the listener to expect a male.

I would argue that &quot;they&quot; would bias the listener to expect multiple people. Also, I believe that the word &quot;programmer&quot; itself carries enough male-expectation bias, so that &quot;he&quot; wouldn&#39;t make any difference. - <b> slacker</b>

              Erik, this joke involves numbers not in base-10. Octal is base-8, and therefore 10 is equivalent to 8 in base-10. So <code>7 10 11</code> becomes <code>7 8 9</code>, or when said... &quot;Seven ate nine!&quot; - <b> The Wicked Flea</b>

              My intuition was that your friend may be a <i>bad</i> programmer, so I just tried this. It took me over half an hour to mergesort a 54-card deck with 2-way merges, because it required 6 full passes through the deck. (I accidentally cleared my stopwatch at the end, so I don&#39;t know the exact time.)  A two-pass 8-way mergesort (repeatedly dealing out 8 cards face up, then picking them up in order, to get 7 sorted subdecks; then placing these 7 sorted subdecks face up and picking up the cards from them in order to form the sorted deck) took 4m22s. My traditional approach took 3m01s. - <b> Kragen Javier Sitaker</b>

              The traditional approach that was ten times as fast as a binary mergesort and 1&#189; times as fast as an 8-way two-pass mergesort consists of a 9-way radix-partitioning pass — partitioning the cards into jokers, face hearts, number hearts, face diamonds, number diamonds, etc. — followed by insertion-sorting each partition and concatenating them.  I haven&#39;t tried quicksort or heapsort yet, but my intuition is that they&#39;ll be slower. - <b> Kragen Javier Sitaker</b>

              Quicksort took 10m51s. The traditional approach of dealing out the 54 cards onto a surface where I could see them all, and then picking them up in order, was 2m42s. Perhaps the closest software analogue is the linear-time algorithm of sorting a number of small integers by setting the appropriate bits in an in-memory bitvector, then reading through the bitvector in order. - <b> Kragen Javier Sitaker</b>

              You&#39;re wrong about the software analog to the &quot;traditional approach&quot;. It is O(n^2) selection sort. Though as I said earlier, the semi-linear eyeball-scan step is hardware-accelerated. - <b> slacker</b>

                <p>This is something I've done before: when counting out change to try and give exact change to a teller or when helping someone at a cash register to give them cash back, you run out of one coin type, and in order to make up for it start looking for negative coins to arrive at the same total. 
AKA the negative one coin to speed up the process of counting out 99 cents. </p>
<p>I said this aloud, and my wife said "people would just throw away the negative coins."</p>

              The cashiers get confused enough when I give them $1.07 for my $0.82 item.  I think their head would exploded if I started handing over anti-pennies. (Not to mention what would happen if the anti-penny came into contact with a regular penny) - <b> kenj0418</b>

              @kenj0418 Well I don&#39;t have access to a particle accelerator so it&#39;d just be a penny with a minus on it.

              +1 for anti-pennies. But if you put one in the same pocket as a penny, they destroy each other and release a small amount of energy. Your change jar would explode, then suck its debris back into the center black hole, and when you got home it would just be missing. &quot;Where did my change jar go?&quot;, you would ask, unaware of the cataclysmic events you&#39;ve unleashed into the spacetime continuum.

                <p>You hear them verbally using very specific programming symbols in conversation. For example, have you ever heard someone say "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octothorpe" rel="nofollow">

              OK, I admit there is less confusion with star/asterisk than bracket/brace/parenthesis. :)

That said, if someone was dictating to me &quot;type open bracket, star, close bracket&quot; I might type &quot;[star]&quot; not realizing they meant to say &quot;type open parenthesis, asterisk, close parenthesis&quot; in which case I would type &quot;(*)&quot; - <b> wweicker</b>

                <p>I saw this question and couldn't resist to answer. I'm probably a little late with the answer but I will submit it anyway.</p>
<p>I think this is a really good question, if not "serious" and "useful" then "humoristic" and "resourceful". I have always wanted to know whether a person fits the "programmer profile" before starting a project with them. Sometimes a person can "pass as a programmer" amongst people that dont know much about computers and technology in general. This person is mainly known as a "poser" or "want to be programmer". Every programmer can identify this person, mock him or accept him.</p>
<p>I always look for a certain pattern in people before I can communicate with them openly. I think that most geeks do, as I cannot share my opinion and intrests if the person doesn't have the same or close to same patterns as me. Maybe I sound selfish, maybe arrogant, but that's the only way I can stay interested in people and have "normal" day to day conversations.</p>
<p>How can you really recognise a programmer from afar? If you focus and look closely, programmers are not hard to spot. They dress casual, plain but comfortable. Programmers come in all "shapes" and "forms", some wear glasses some dont, some are really tall, some are really fat, etc. They dont care about their look (they only care about the code), unless they are going to a programmers convention. Other people describe them as loners and distant.</p>
<p>Programmers identify programmers from afar. It's a given, natural thing that all programmers possess. It's "embedded" into us.</p>

Should I pick an apple juice or grape juice? grape gives me heartburn, apple is 3% more expensive, grape has 60% natural juice concentrate while apple has 65%, apple is slightly more tasty, but grape seems to have more vitamins...</p>

                <p>They say stuff like this(The engineer, in this case):</p>
<p>A priest, a doctor, and an engineer were waiting one morning at the third tee (par 3, 185 yards, slight dog leg to left, water hazard on the right) while a particularly slow group of golfers were flailing away ahead of them.</p>
<p>Engineer: What's with these guys? We've been waiting for 15 minutes!</p>
<p>Doctor: I don't know but I've never seen such ineptitude!</p>
<p>Priest: Hey, here comes the green keeper. Let's have a word with him. Hi George. Say George, what's with that group ahead of us? They're rather slow, aren't they?</p>
<p>George: Oh yes. That's a group of blind fire fighters. They lost their sight while saving our club house last year. So we let them play here anytime free of charge!</p>
<p>Doctor: Wow! Thanks for the scoop George.</p>
<p>Priest: That's so sad. I think I will say a special prayer for them tonight.</p>
<p>Doctor: Good idea. And I'm going to contact my ophthalmologist buddy and see if there's anything he can do for them.</p>
<p>After a short pause ...</p>
<p>Engineer: Why can't these guys play at night?</p>

                <p>To find whether a person i a computer programer.I have one idea.This might not be always correct.</p>
<p>Check the bottom of the wrist ,It should be rough and hard since he is always using the mouse and his wrist(postion where the wrist come in contact with the desk) will become hard.So u can shake your hands to someone to find whether he is using computer always.</p>
<p>This will not work out for one who doesent use mouse.
The might be wrong in case when we find persons who always plays computer games with mouse. :)</p>

                <p>Here's a great example from my real-life life.</p>
<p>Software development has taught me to find problems and bad design, proactively. Further, it has taught me to try to fix them, and occasionally report them at a status meeting or into some bug database, etc.</p>
<p>As a result, any time my daily workflow is interrupted (Specifically driving, grocery runs, etc), I immediately locate the "cause" or the person at "fault". I'll blame the thing or person directly (as a fix), or utter a snide comment (as a status update / TODO), and go on with my day as if nothing happened.</p>
<p>People think I'm just complaining, but I'm really trying to improve the world in my own little way.</p>

                <p>you can't! All of the methods thus far that truly mark a programmer have relied upon active observation vs. passive observation(the type of observation the question was referring to). Do you really think that you can pick a programmer out of a crowd of people based upon appearance,clothing, and affectations? Considering all of the physical characteristics, general habits, and sleep cycles whats the difference between a college student and a computer programmer (I'm not saying that these two are mutually exclusive I'm merely stating that the similar qualities are striking)?  Honestly I don't see much.That holds true anyways until the programmer opens their mouth... </p>

                <p>The following sentence is abnormal for a programmer:</p>

<p>because the programmer's meaning of "or" is different than common sense "or", therefore, the statement above means:</p>
<p>I will try to die, if I failed to die, I will find [you].</p>
<p>They add brackets (or quotes or formatting) to reduce ambiguity in English language.</p>
<ul>
<li>(British Colombia)-ians are also Canadians.</li>
<li>The (n + 1)th number.</li>
<li>Two times (three plus two).</li>
<li>Eat (rice, fish and vegetables) and watch TV.</li>
</ul>
<p>They may treat English "and" like "cons" in Lisp:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eat rice and (fish and vegetables).</li>
<li>The cow that caught skin disease (that caught skin disease (that caught skin disease (that caught skin disease ...))). (see <a href="http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/File:Fractal_Cow.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/File:Fractal_Cow.jpg</a> )</li>
</ul>
<p>Logical quotes is a must:</p>
<ul>
<li>He said, "I was on the phone.".</li>
</ul>
<p>The following sentences are invalid for a programmer (debatable):</p>
<ul>
<li>He said, "I heard someone said on the phone: 'He is in Bob's house.'.".</li>
<li>(a smiley inside the parentheses :))</li>
</ul>
<p>They think an ideal human language uses programming operators.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>yesterday { I-&gt;eat({$x : @red, @length(0.12), @fish}); } -- the default length unit is meter</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Prolog style:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>today(X), yesterday(X, Yesterday), do(Yesterday, i, eat, [Fish]), red(Fish), length(Fish, 0.12)</code></li>
