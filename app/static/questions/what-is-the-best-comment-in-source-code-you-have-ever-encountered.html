                <p>I am particularly guilty of this, embedding non-constructive comments, code poetry and little jokes into most of my projects (although I usually have enough sense to remove anything directly offensive before releasing the code). Here's one I'm particulary fond of, placed far, far down a poorly-designed 'God Object':</p>
<pre><code>/**
* For the brave souls who get this far: You are the chosen ones,
* the valiant knights of programming who toil away, without rest,
* fixing our most awful code. To you, true saviors, kings of men,
* I say this: never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down,
* never gonna run around and desert you. Never gonna make you cry,
* never gonna say goodbye. Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.
*/
</code></pre>
<p><strong>I'M SORRY!!!!</strong> I just couldn't help myself.....!</p>
<p>And another, which I'll admit I haven't actually released into the wild, even though I am <em>very</em> tempted to do so in one of my less intuitive classes:</p>
<pre><code>// 
// Dear maintainer:
// 
// Once you are done trying to 'optimize' this routine,
// and have realized what a terrible mistake that was,
// please increment the following counter as a warning
// to the next guy:

              When I wake up from truly deep sleep, my IQ drops to about 25, and my mind goes extremely strange places.  Once, after a long stint of writing java, I woke up in the middle of the night feeling quite ill, and bolted to the bathroom.  As I vomited into the toilet, the only thing I could think was &quot;I wonder which exception I&#39;m throwing right now...&quot; - <b> Frank Farmer</b>

              @Dana: Censorship is a tool. It sucks in the wrong context, is useful in the right. This site would do well to censor such things.

              Rolling back to the original author&#39;s accepted version - If you roll it back to the NSFW version, be aware that this is NOT what the author did (see his revision 3 and revision 6 if you aren&#39;t sure what he really wanted).

              Geez that&#39;s a lot of controversy.  As the original poster let me clear something up:  It was SFW-ed by an editor in Rev 2.  I disagreed with this but let it go, adding a disclaimer in Rev 3 saying that it -had been- SFW-ed.   It was reverted to NSFW and in Rev 6 -I- SFWed it because at the time it was in danger of being deleted from being offensive.  I would prefer the NSFW version because I think it&#39;s a better preservation of the bite of the ORIGINAL author (who wrote the code). - <b> Tom Ritter</b>

              I leave NSFW/SFW up to the moderators.  This is an extreme case of casual cursing.  Is casual cursing allowed?  If it is, I think it really pushes the envelope but is allowable.  If it is not, then SFW it. - <b> Tom Ritter</b>

              The primary question for me in this case is: &quot;Is the original swearing so important that it&#39;s worth tripping overly strict work and school filters and blocking the site for some users?&quot;  If it&#39;s important to preserve the original and possibly end up on a few site blacklists (especially to primary education schools and libraries) then go ahead, but if the overall sense of it can be preserved using the fake swear words, then why not? - <b> Adam Davis</b>

              Further, this IS offensive to some people, regardless of your personal views, and it will be flagged as such over time.  You can argue all you want, but at the end of the day some people do find this language objectionable.  Perhaps a NSFW tag would allay that - at least then at the beginning they should know they might find personally objectionable material, but it won&#39;t prevent all of them from voting accordingly. - <b> Adam Davis</b>

              As given this would actually work though: the comment-till-end-of-line characters make sure that likely lines where this macro is used will not compile. For example: <code>a = TRUE;</code> will translate to <code>a = FALSE &#47;&#47; Happy debugging suckers;</code> which will lead to a compile error because the termating <code>;</code> is now in comments. If you use the block comment <code>&#47;* Eat this *&#47;</code> it will work. - <b> rix0rrr</b>

              Depends on the comments. Even &quot;self-documenting&quot; languages can benefit from comments, such as Python. I hate having to slog through the code to figure out what is happening, when a simple sentence can tell me. - <b> crystalattice</b>

              I disagree re: comments being unnecessary.  There are times when a simple &quot;framing&quot; comment can make sense of a whole slew of code. For example, if you are using a sophisticated algorithm to escape the time complexity of a brute force algorithm, a reference can be essential. - <b> Mark Brittingham</b>

              For example //Using Sophisticated algorithm because we found brute force methods to take too long.
That way when the next programmer comes through later and doesn&#39;t know how to maintain sophisticated algorithm they don&#39;t make the mistake of trying to switch to a brute force method. - <b> Bryan Anderson</b>

              IMHO. A good framing comment can be useful but wouldn&#39;t be particularly memorable as a &quot;best&quot; comment. If a comment is informative enough to be really memorable, then the code is too complicated. The only memorable comments are bad, funny, or good explanations of poor code. - <b> MarkJ</b>

              We had code that deleted a record from the DB, but insisted on checking the number of rows affected and throwing an exception if it was 0. But if the record was already gone, rows affected = 0 was perfectly fine. I used a similar comment in that case. - <b> Matt Peterson</b>

<pre><code>// At this point, I'd like to take a moment to speak to you about the Adobe PSD
// format. PSD is not a good format. PSD is not even a bad format. Calling it
// such would be an insult to other bad formats, such as PCX or JPEG. No, PSD
// is an abysmal format. Having worked on this code for several weeks now, my
// hate for PSD has grown to a raging fire that burns with the fierce passion
// of a million suns.
//
// If there are two different ways of doing something, PSD will do both, in
// different places. It will then make up three more ways no sane human would
// think of, and do those too. PSD makes inconsistency an art form. Why, for
// instance, did it suddenly decide that *these* particular chunks should be
// aligned to four bytes, and that this alignement should *not* be included in
// the size? Other chunks in other places are either unaligned, or aligned with
// the alignment included in the size. Here, though, it is not included. Either
// one of these three behaviours would be fine. A sane format would pick one.
// PSD, of course, uses all three, and more.
//
// Trying to get data out of a PSD file is like trying to find something in the
// attic of your eccentric old uncle who died in a freak freshwater shark
// attack on his 58th birthday. That last detail may not be important for the
// purposes of the simile, but at this point I am spending a lot of time
// imagining amusing fates for the people responsible for this Rube Goldberg of
// a file format.
//
// Earlier, I tried to get a hold of the latest specs for the PSD file format.
// To do this, I had to apply to them for permission to apply to them to have
// them consider sending me this sacred tome. This would have involved faxing
// them a copy of some document or other, probably signed in blood. I can only
// imagine that they make this process so difficult because they are intensely
// ashamed of having created this abomination. I was naturally not gullible
// enough to go through with this procedure, but if I had done so, I would have
// printed out every single page of the spec, and set them all on fire. Were it
// within my power, I would gather every single copy of those specs, and launch
// them on a spaceship directly into the sun.
//
// PSD is not my favourite file format.

              He was lying, when he said he had a proof that wouldn&#39;t fit, if he did, it was flawed.  It was an intuitive proof, it feels right, but you can&#39;t say why.  Saying he had a proof was sort of a joke among his peers. - <b> Karl</b>

                <p>Many years ago (about 1994) I was working on a Oracle PRO*C application for a large multi-national software company that you will have heard of. The app I was working on was a massive Oracle application and they had a utility that ran overnight tidying up data and doing all sorts of aggregate calculations. Every time anything needed doing as a batch job, it got shoved into this utility and as you can imagine it became an absolute monstrosity. It was also notable for the tiny number of comments that it had for such a massive program.</p>
<p>One of the few comments it did have remains the finest comment I have ever seen for pure WTF'ness... I was trying to find a bug in a function which was hundreds of lines long and right in the middle of it was the <strong>only</strong> comment in the function:</p>
<pre><code>/* I did this the other way */
</code></pre>
<p>To this day it is still the finest comment I have ever seen.</p>

<sup style="font-size:9px">[1]</sup>:</p>
<pre><code>/*
Major subtleties ahead:  Most hash schemes depend on having a "good" hash
function, in the sense of simulating randomness.  Python doesn't:  its most
important hash functions (for strings and ints) are very regular in common
cases:

&gt;&gt;&gt; map(hash, (0, 1, 2, 3))
[0, 1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; map(hash, ("namea", "nameb", "namec", "named"))
[-1658398457, -1658398460, -1658398459, -1658398462]
&gt;&gt;&gt;

This isn't necessarily bad!  To the contrary, in a table of size 2**i, taking
the low-order i bits as the initial table index is extremely fast, and there
are no collisions at all for dicts indexed by a contiguous range of ints.
The same is approximately true when keys are "consecutive" strings.  So this
gives better-than-random behavior in common cases, and that's very desirable.

OTOH, when collisions occur, the tendency to fill contiguous slices of the
hash table makes a good collision resolution strategy crucial.  Taking only
the last i bits of the hash code is also vulnerable:  for example, consider
[i &lt;&lt; 16 for i in range(20000)] as a set of keys.  Since ints are their own
hash codes, and this fits in a dict of size 2**15, the last 15 bits of every
hash code are all 0:  they *all* map to the same table index.

But catering to unusual cases should not slow the usual ones, so we just take
the last i bits anyway.  It's up to collision resolution to do the rest.  If
we *usually* find the key we're looking for on the first try (and, it turns
out, we usually do -- the table load factor is kept under 2/3, so the odds
are solidly in our favor), then it makes best sense to keep the initial index
computation dirt cheap.

The first half of collision resolution is to visit table indices via this
recurrence:

    j = ((5*j) + 1) mod 2**i

For any initial j in range(2**i), repeating that 2**i times generates each
int in range(2**i) exactly once (see any text on random-number generation for
proof).  By itself, this doesn't help much:  like linear probing (setting
j += 1, or j -= 1, on each loop trip), it scans the table entries in a fixed
order.  This would be bad, except that's not the only thing we do, and it's
actually *good* in the common cases where hash keys are consecutive.  In an
example that's really too small to make this entirely clear, for a table of
size 2**3 the order of indices is:

    0 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 6 -&gt; 7 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 0 [and here it's repeating]

If two things come in at index 5, the first place we look after is index 2,
not 6, so if another comes in at index 6 the collision at 5 didn't hurt it.
Linear probing is deadly in this case because there the fixed probe order
is the *same* as the order consecutive keys are likely to arrive.  But it's
extremely unlikely hash codes will follow a 5*j+1 recurrence by accident,
and certain that consecutive hash codes do not.

The other half of the strategy is to get the other bits of the hash code
into play.  This is done by initializing a (unsigned) vrbl "perturb" to the
full hash code, and changing the recurrence to:

    j = (5*j) + 1 + perturb;
    perturb &gt;&gt;= PERTURB_SHIFT;
    use j % 2**i as the next table index;

Now the probe sequence depends (eventually) on every bit in the hash code,
and the pseudo-scrambling property of recurring on 5*j+1 is more valuable,
because it quickly magnifies small differences in the bits that didn't affect
the initial index.  Note that because perturb is unsigned, if the recurrence
is executed often enough perturb eventually becomes and remains 0.  At that
point (very rarely reached) the recurrence is on (just) 5*j+1 again, and
that's certain to find an empty slot eventually (since it generates every int
in range(2**i), and we make sure there's always at least one empty slot).

Selecting a good value for PERTURB_SHIFT is a balancing act.  You want it
small so that the high bits of the hash code continue to affect the probe
sequence across iterations; but you want it large so that in really bad cases
the high-order hash bits have an effect on early iterations.  5 was "the
best" in minimizing total collisions across experiments Tim Peters ran (on
both normal and pathological cases), but 4 and 6 weren't significantly worse.

Historical:  Reimer Behrends contributed the idea of using a polynomial-based
approach, using repeated multiplication by x in GF(2**n) where an irreducible
polynomial for each table size was chosen such that x was a primitive root.
Christian Tismer later extended that to use division by x instead, as an
efficient way to get the high bits of the hash code into play.  This scheme
also gave excellent collision statistics, but was more expensive:  two
if-tests were required inside the loop; computing "the next" index took about
the same number of operations but without as much potential parallelism
(e.g., computing 5*j can go on at the same time as computing 1+perturb in the
above, and then shifting perturb can be done while the table index is being
masked); and the dictobject struct required a member to hold the table's
polynomial.  In Tim's experiments the current scheme ran faster, produced
equally good collision statistics, needed less code &amp; used less memory.

Theoretical Python 2.5 headache:  hash codes are only C "long", but
sizeof(Py_ssize_t) &gt; sizeof(long) may be possible.  In that case, and if a
dict is genuinely huge, then only the slots directly reachable via indexing
by a C long can be the first slot in a probe sequence.  The probe sequence
will still eventually reach every slot in the table, but the collision rate
on initial probes may be much higher than this scheme was designed for.
Getting a hash code as fat as Py_ssize_t is the only real cure.  But in
practice, this probably won't make a lick of difference for many years (at
which point everyone will have terabytes of RAM on 64-bit boxes).

              To commentators: If its a blog post or a separate document, it&#39;s NOT THERE when someone goes to modify the code.  Having it in the code is the most convenient for future maintainers.  And if the code is changed, there&#39;s a good chance the maintainer will update the comment; there&#39;s less chance a document or blog post would be changed (and if it was changed then you lose the docs for old versions; comments get versioned in the version control system with the code). - <b> user9876</b>

              No C++ operator overload trickery here. The code in the &quot;else&quot; block handled the case of r==0 just fine. Presumably the intent of the original author was to do some special processing in the r==0 state.   Since the code in the &quot;if (r=0)&quot; block never got executed, they eventually fixed it in the other block, leaving that useless code up at the top. Now, the guys who kept &quot;fixing&quot; it didn&#39;t have any reason to be modifying that code, and they certainly never tested the code after they changed it. Keeping the code exactly as we got it from the vendor made it easier to integrate future versions. - <b> Mark Bessey</b>

                <p>The original Doom had an engine with static walls that could not move; the result was that all doors opened vertically; nothing could ever move horizontally.  I burst out laughing when, after the source code was released, I was looking through the code and saw this in the source file for handling doors, at the start of a big block of commented-out code:</p>
<pre><code>// UNUSED
// Separate into p_slidoor.c?

              Basically, the 2D geometry of the level is precompiled into a tree structure that allows efficient sorting of walls during rendering.  But, because it&#39;s precompiled, you can&#39;t change it at runtime. Hexen, which was based on Doom, had a hack for moving walls (doors etc), but it was very limited. - <b> Simon Howard</b>

   Never, ever fly Air France.  Their customer service is absolutely
   the worst.  I've never heard the words "That's not my problem" as 
   many times as I have from their staff -- It should, without doubt
   be their corporate motto if it isn't already.  Don't bother giving 
   them business because you're just a pain in their side and they
   will be sure to let you know the first time you speak to them.

   If you ever want to make me happy just tell me that you, too, will
   never fly Air France again either (in spite of their excellent
   cuisine). 

   Update by oej: The merger with KLM has transferred this
   behaviour to KLM as well. 
   Don't bother giving them business either...

   Only if you want to travel randomly without luggage, you
   might pick either of them.

              That&#39;s fine, but how about adding some tests to prove it. I had precisely that situ last night: found maths code (written by me) that I didn&#39;t believe could work - but the unit tests proved it did. - <b> endian</b>

              Formally speaking, tests don&#39;t &quot;prove&quot; a formula, they only show it works on specific cases. But I&#39;d include them anyway - a few useful cases would give more confidence, <i>and</i> detect failures if somebody &quot;optimizes&quot; it. - <b> chester</b>

<pre>
/*
    Description: The Total Perspective Vortex derives its picture of the
                 whole Universe  on the principle of extrapolated matter
                 analyses.

                 To  explain  -  since every piece of matter in the Universe
                 is in some way affected by every other piece of matter in
                 the  Universe,  it  is  in  theory possible to extrapolate
                 the whole of creation - every sun, every planet, their
                 orbits, their composition and their economic and social
                 history from, say, one small Macro.

                 The man who invented the Total Perspective Vortex did so
                 basically in order to annoy the IT department.

                 Steve Weet - for that was his name - was a dreamer, a
                 thinker, a speculative philosopher or, as some would have
                 it, a slacker.

                 And they would nag him incessantly about the utterly
                 inordinate amount of time he spent staring out into space,
                 or mulling over the mechanics of Chelsea FC, or doing
                 spectrographic analyses of macros.

                 "Have  some  sense  of  proportion!"  they would say,
                 sometimes as often as thirty-eight times in a single day.

                 And so he built the Total Perspective Vortex - just to show
                 them.

                 And into one end he plugged the whole of reality as
                 extrapolated  from one  macro, and into the other
                 end he plugged the IT department: so that when he turned it
                 on they saw in one instant the whole infinity of creation 
                 and theirselves in relation to it.

                 To  Steve Weet's horror, the shock completely annihilated '
                 their brains; but to his satisfaction he realized that he
                 had proved conclusively that if life is going to exist in a
                 Universe of this size, then the one thing it cannot afford
                 to have is a sense of proportion.

              @overtone: Generally, objects are said to be <i>immutable</i> if they cannot be changed in-place. For example, strings are immutable in Java: If you want to change any character, you have to copy the whole string in the process. You cannot change an existing string. In this example, immutable simply means that the interfaces are fixed can may in no case be changed. - <b> Felix Dombek</b>

<p>This one was left behind by a contractor who had been working on a chunk of code responsible for testing email logins.  We were in disbelief so we tried it out and it was a valid login to his personal account; we double-checked the revision history and he had two check-ins that edited it: one to add the code, and the second to comment it out.</p>
<p>We added the artwork and left the rest alone; another dev decided it would be fun to send him emails from his future self (ala The Office) and said it took nearly two full weeks of daily emails before the login stopped working.</p>

<p>My favorite part isn't that he did it, or that he accidently left it in place for a check-in--but that when he came back across it he just commented it out rather than deleting it.  We never would have looked at the original revision if we never knew it was there :-D</p>

<pre><code>	// At this point, I'd like to take a moment to speak to you about the Adobe PSD format.
	// PSD is not a good format. PSD is not even a bad format. Calling it such would be an
	// insult to other bad formats, such as PCX or JPEG. No, PSD is an abysmal format. Having
	// worked on this code for several weeks now, my hate for PSD has grown to a raging fire
	// that burns with the fierce passion of a million suns.
	// If there are two different ways of doing something, PSD will do both, in different
	// places. It will then make up three more ways no sane human would think of, and do those
	// too. PSD makes inconsistency an art form. Why, for instance, did it suddenly decide
	// that *these* particular chunks should be aligned to four bytes, and that this alignement
	// should *not* be included in the size? Other chunks in other places are either unaligned,
	// or aligned with the alignment included in the size. Here, though, it is not included.
	// Either one of these three behaviours would be fine. A sane format would pick one. PSD,
	// of course, uses all three, and more.
	// Trying to get data out of a PSD file is like trying to find something in the attic of
	// your eccentric old uncle who died in a freak freshwater shark attack on his 58th

	// was naturally not gullible enough to go through with this procedure, but if I had done
	// so, I would have printed out every single page of the spec, and set them all on fire.
	// Were it within my power, I would gather every single copy of those specs, and launch
	// them on a spaceship directly into the sun.

                <p>When I was taking a CS class in Highschool, we were being taught in a regular classroom - no computers. All our tests were done on paper that we handed in - one class per sheet of paper. Our teacher was teaching the class in C++ for the first time and would occasionally switch into Pascal mode on the chalkboard. This was awkward, as few of us had interest in learning Pascal.</p>
<p>For larger than in class work, we would do them at home and hand in code + output printouts to be graded. After submitting a few code + output printouts, we collectively realized that the teacher wasn't actually reading the code - just the printouts. To test our theory, I put in a comment on the 3rd page of my code - right between some class declarations:</p>
<pre><code>// If you are reading this, please place a checkmark here [  ]

<p>Of course, I got it back with a big blue "A" on the front and no checkmark to be found.</p>

              As dirty as that code reads, the result is that you put a male in a collection of women. So when the next programmer uses the list of women, he gets a male and uses it as a woman. So whereas the first programmer thinks his guy is lucky, the next one ensures the guy gets the equivalent treatment of dropping the soap. - <b> Xaade</b>

                <p>Spelunking through the Hardware Abstraction Layer while working for a certain Finnish Mobile Network Equipment Manufacturer I found 100+ occurrences of the Finnish word "puukko".</p>
<p>A 'puukko' is an all purpose knife that every Finn has in their toolbox or around the house. It is used for everything from pealing potatoes to performing computer repairs (my observations). I believe in this context it is the Finnish equivalent of the word 'Hack'. </p>
<p>My Finnish colleagues denied this and said it meant something more like 'surgical procedure/intervention'... and I almost believed them until I found the comment: </p>

This is a gathering place for all unit tests.
Create a TUnitTestWrapper, then call "RunAllUnitTests".

This class will create an instance of each thing to be tested, and call each of
their unit tests.

It does not really do any testing on it's own; it just gives a common place from
which to call everyone else's tests.

This way, one day, we can automate our testing with each build. [Cue laughter]

                <p>I don't have the code to share, but imagine this scenario.  About a month or two after our Linux Sys Admin left for greener pastures, I had the pleasure of opening a shell script he'd written.  I can't recall why I needed to edit it, but that's not what matters.  What's important is that the script was about 40 lines long.  I scrolled past the commenting (of which there were 37 lines) to reach the actual working code (3 lines).  The code was great, but I was curious - why 37 lines of commenting?  So, I scrolled to the top and proceeded to read.  To my surprise, the commenting was a rap about what the three lines of code did and how to change it.  The best part - it was a partial rip off of Nothing But A G Thing by Dr. Dre and Snoop D O DOUBLE G.  Thanks Brian!</p>

                <p>Many years ago I picked up the job to provide support to a project that ran real 
time on a Z80 and was in assembly (is there any other way to do Z80??)
Anyway, the original author was a Nigerian guy by the name of Moses. Maybe I should just 
stop there.
Anyway, scattered throughout the code was this:</p>
<pre><code>XRA A    ;MT
</code></pre>
<p>Took me awhile to figure out what this was. The instruction itself does nothing more
than clear the accumulator. It's a slick way, although I'm not sure if there is an 
advantage or not. you can just do:</p>
<pre><code>LDA 0
</code></pre>
<p>But maybe</p>
<pre><code>XRA A
</code></pre>
<p>saves a byte or something. What is does is exclusive or the accumulator with itself.
The result is, of course, always zero. </p>
<p>Back to the MT - Empty (get it?)</p>
<p>That's the best I've run across.</p>

              The XOR A,A (which I think was the Z80 mnemonic, the other most likely 8080) is a single byte opcode.  The LD A,0 is a two byte opcode.

He probably just should have made a ZEROA macro or so :) - <b> Thorbj√∏rn Ravn Andersen</b>

<p>This probably spoils the joke a bit, but since it's a bit obscure I'll explain:</p>
<p>"TR" here refers to "Twisted Reality".  Zope 2 and the original <code>twisted.reality</code> package made extensive and unfortunate use of multiple inheritance, which could make it difficult to understand what was going on when you saw a method call.

                <p>This one was amusing for others but less so for me. I had inherited the code (which was ASP) from a developer who had himself inherited it. The first programmer had created some very hard to understand code. The second developer had added a comment as follows (names hidden to protect the not-so-innocent):</p>
<pre><code>'This code was written by **************.
'I haven't a clue what it does. He hasn't a clue what it does.
'Nobody else has a clue what it does or how it does it.
'It is something to do with data but **** knows what.
'The ******* still works so please do not change this code,
'even though it is a complete pile of ****.

<p>So why didn't I find it amusing? Well, it was ASP code for a customer's intranet.</p>
<p>...and it was the customer who highlighted the comment to me.</p>

                <p>It's not strictly speaking a comment, but...</p>
<p>It was the mid-1990s and I was working on a big migration: small software vendor, <strong>big</strong> client, lots of pressure. We had a lot of shifting-goalpost stuff; the project was very hard to control. I was the key developer, but new to the system, and the other developer was the vendor's owner/founder.</p>
<p>After a few months of not quite making deadlines and not quite satisfying the client, the owner/founder brought on another developer, who was working remotely. (I'm gonna go out on a limb and say the new developer had lesser skills and experience than me.)</p>
<p>Well, the new guy made some changes in code that I'd already worked on, and then a month or two later I was back in the same area of the code, and there were variables I hadn't seen before. With names like <code>StupidMark</code>.</p>
<p>Dude, that's just not right. I mean, there's teamwork considerations, but also: in this environment, <em>variable names can show up in runtime error messages.</em> I'm just saying.</p>
<p>In my opinion at the time, the new guy's code wasn't getting us much closer to a deliverable product anyway, which made the insult sting a little more.</p>

                <p>For a memcache wrapper/handler interface pattern class I wrote, I had the following method implemented.</p>
<pre><code>/**
*  Do not use, ever - left in place for testing purposes
*/
function  I_David_WillHuntYouDownAndHurtYou_Badly_IfIFindThisUsedAnyWhereInTheAppLibrary(){
...
}
</code></pre>
<p>This was basically a super nuke function to tell all the indvidual memcache services to completely flush themselves, and start over with the individual name space counters I used for keys ( ex .{_counter_key value}_.{_counter_key value} )</p>
<p>Another minor novella I wrote was for an automated downloader for a data vendor, detailing how much I hated this vendor and went to great lengths of postulating that their infrastructure's batch system was run by a gerbil, running on a wheel and after so many revolutions of the wheel the next queued task would be started.  It was written over the course of 6 months of adding additional exception handling, estoric checks like ( if we got 768 Bytes of \s characters, that means the query to their DB timed out and the spaces are the result of empty failure print statements.</p>

<pre><code>  //ok, this is a hairy, dirty, and nasty piece of code

  //do it all yourself.  Frankly, I still have xmas shopping to do
  //and I really don't want us to be foobared when we get
  //even more extension methods added to LINQ
  //therefore, we are pulling execute based on taking the calling the 
  //standard execute on enumerable, but using our own class
  //
  //optimization can occur from here on an as needed basis, that is
  //check for the value of mex.Method.Name, and write a handler for
  //that method
  //
  //also, it may not be a bad idea to rather than do this reflection 
  //each and every time somehow cache the reflected methodinfos and do 
  //lookups that way that said, we need a complete red/green/refactor 
  //cycle here before I am touching that one

                <p>Some years ago I was working in a large code base that had no unit-testing to speak of.</p>
<p>There was a method buried deep within the code that performed some calendar calculations. It was somewhat broken, had to deal with daylight savings in a very clumsy way due to some unfortunate circumstances.</p>
<p>We had to fix it a couple of times, and every time, we would find something broken some months after.</p>
<p>After spending a whole day fixing it and analyzing it, I put the code in source control, along with a comment that said something like this:</p>
<pre><code>// this code was written after a version trying to do {this} failed because of {reason},
// previously we were doing {this} which failed because of {reason}. This is 
// now written {this} way so that {lots of reasons here}. If you want to touch
// this code, please make sure that it produces the right answers when tested with:
//
// {some sort of unit test}

body {
        /* Really important stuff here */
        /* Of course, comment or not, this will all get ignored by Safari because 
           its the first rule after the comments which break everything.

<p>The funny thing is on the web you'll find people's solutions are to just enter in a bogus element as the first rule below the charset statement to get ignored and proceed as normal...</p>

<p>Sidenote:  I know this shouldn't be needed due to headers, meta rules etc.  Unfortunately we need it as a catch all :(</p>

<p>Many system calls had been forgotten.</p>
<p>When I got onboard the code was laced with such gems as:</p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<p>'STYLE
    'It's arguable which is better, but I pass the image handle rather than simply
    'passing the scaling values in order to keep the calling code simpler (by a
    'couple of declarations statements). Alternatively, I could pass these data
    'members directly from the calling code, but that would violate encapsulation.</p>
<p>'STYLE
'As I have done elsewhere, I will <strong>register my offical protest</strong> (just give me the
'forms to fill out) regarding the implementation of annotation serialization as
'a property rather than a pair of Load/Save methods. Again, this is probably a
'matter of style and eminently debatable.</p>

                <p>A large project I worked on used StyleCop and FXCop in the automated build with rules to prevent people checking in code with uncommented fields, methods, properties etc., etc.</p>
<p>Someone got so pissed off with having to add comments like "<strong>Gets or sets the full name.</strong>" to self-documenting properties like <strong>FullName</strong>, that they went to the effort of writing a macro to get around the rules. </p>
<p>The macro inserted XML summary tags for methods, properties etc. with a single non-displaying Unicode character as the tag content which would fool the build rules whilst simultaneously striking his minor blow against mindless insistence on commenting stuff for the sake of it...</p>
<p>...at least until they introduced another rule to check for Unicode characters in comments.</p>

// Novel idea, why didn't we query for the values be get below all in the same place.

// This should be changed, but right now it will have to remain as is due to time constraints.

                <p>I was doing a database in Access, very simple thing - at least it was supposed to be at the start or I would have done it in Delphi.  The client wanted to be able to get the customer info out of the database but they would not enter enough information to reliably identify the customer.  I told them to use the phone number as the key as each customer (the way they worked, not for everyone) would have a different number.  After a few frantic calls from them, (It's not working we can't enter the customer) I discovered that they were too lazy to look up the phone numbers from their old system and were trying to enter all the numbers they did not know as "n/a".  In trying to sort this out for them I ended up with a lot of checking loops in the code and had the comment beside one outcome "This should never be reached if they do what they are supposed to do!!!!!!!!!"</p>
<p>They also asked me once "How can we find the right customer even if we put in the wrong address?" And all for peanuts.</p>

                <p>Re eating one's own dogfood: We have the same term in our workplace (granted, only because I introduced it). My code is peppered with comments that say "TODO" and indicate something that ought to be done eventually, but a comment saying "DOGFOOD" (both keywords are always at the beginning of the comment, in all caps) means something that must be done before this program can be used even internally. It's a handy thing to search for, as the word "dogfood" is never going to appear in a quoted string - if it does, I can always just say "dog-food" or something - so even a case-insensitive search will come up with the right results.</p>
<p>Regarding zeroing the accumulator: I've done exactly the same thing when programming an Intel 80x86 (I started on the 8086 and moved up from there into the modern Pentiums). XORing a register with itself is the quickest and tightest way to clear it. Using "MOV AX,0" requires three bytes (opcode and two bytes of literal 16-bit zero), whereas "XOR AX,AX" is only two; it's even more noticeable with the 386-and-higher extended registers, where "MOV EAX,0" requires five bytes (four bytes of 32-bit zero). My C/C++ compiler always zeroes registers this way, so I'd assume it's still the best way (although I haven't studied opcode timing tables in ages, and probably both XOR reg,reg and MOV reg,imm take one clock).</p>
