<hr />
<p>These days server naming is a bit of a lost art. Most large organizations don't allow for fanciful names and name their servers with jumbles of digits and letters. In the olden days just about every system administrator came up with a unique naming scheme, well, sometimes unique - many just settled for Star Trek characters. </p>
<p>To this day my favorite server name is Qantas - a Unix server that Joel Spolsky has or used to have. Why Qantas? You'd have to ask Rainman.</p>
<p>So my question is this - what is the coolest server name or naming convention that you encountered? Let the geekfest begin.</p>

                    There really is nothing cool about starting work at a new company to find all the 2000 servers have cool names that have no relation to their function. Functional names maybe dull but they lower the learning curve when you&#39;re getting to grips with the systems.Use cnames for the &quot;cool&quot; names. - <b> Geoff</b>

                    Functional names never work, IME.  You name a server and three years later it&#39;s doing something completely different from what you thought it was going to be used for.

Also, you get wonderful servernames like miscSQL1, which is about as helpful as a chocolate teapot. - <b> Richard Gadsden</b>

                    Nowdays with Virtual machines, I think functional names are perfect.  I takes me about 4 minutes to copy a vhd and run NewSid on a Windows Server image and have a brand new machine for any simple task.  Three years later I might have 50 VMs instead of 5 Physical hosts, but they are much easier to manage. - <b> BLAKE</b>

                    When I was a LAN/WAN admin at an ISP I used names from ancient Egypt: my PC was Tutankhamon, the dialup server was Cleopatra, the web server was Isis, and so on. One of my customer uses names of Italian wines. A customer once had a good idea: he bought a poster of all Pokemon characters and asked each user to put a post-it with his/her name on a character; the PC had the name of Pokemon characters and the poster was a link between PC names and users. - <b> lrosa</b>

                    @tony roth how can you judge how useful/less something is if you have never used it?  Even if the task it was designed for already had a solution (sysprep), does not make the program useless.  I &#39;USE&#39; it daily because I prefer it to sysprep, so the term &#39;useless&#39; is incorrect.  &#39;Useless&#39; means that it has no beneficial use, but I do use it, making th eprogram all but useless. - <b> BLAKE</b>

                    @BLAKE: Sysprep does more than simply creating a new SID and doing a global sear6ch/replace on the registry (more or less); it &quot;resets other machine-specific state that, if duplicated, can cause problems for certain applications like Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)&quot; as well.

                <p>The funniest server name story I have is from when I worked at the Kennedy Space Center.  On our particular project, our main server was named snowwhite, and the 7 client workstations were named after the Seven Dwarves.  The kicker is, one day one of our engineers ran into a Disney Imagineer who worked at Walt Disney World, and they started talking about server names.  The Disney Imagineer said "that's funny, we have a group of servers named columbia, challenger, atlantis, and discovery."</p>

              we did exactly the same thing! However the 4 application servers were called &quot;Tigger, Eeyore, Piglet and Pooh&quot;, and to make it obvious which one you were connected to, the colour themes were orange, grey, pink and yellow. - <b> gbjbaanb</b>

                <p>Use <strong><a href="http://labs.google.com/sets" rel="nofollow">
Google Sets
</a><sup style="font-size:9px">[1]</sup></strong> to expand a list of a few items, into a list with many items. For example let's suppose you want a set (or list) of Star Wars characters, but can only think of a few.

              Meh, it&#39;s not very accurate or flexible.  I fed it a list of Middle Earth cities, and it gave me back some real world locations mixed with general Middle Earth geography (as opposed to cities).  I fed it a list of fictional starship names and it zeroed in on the two Star Trek ones and just gave me words associated with Star Trek, followed by a bunch of words in Klingon.

                <p>One of my inventions, of which I was the most proud, was a server naming scheme I came up with at a previous employer. It was called the RFB scheme. We had a tradition in place of using rather tasteless humour for determining systemic nomenclatures. Previously, we'd employed a convention a friend of mine had suggested, using euphemisms for vomiting ( yak, ralph, hurl, chunder etc. ) but this had leaked up towards management who freaked that it might offend potential customers if the hostnames were somehow exposed, via mail headers or some such, and firmly suggested we change it to something tamer.</p>
<p>So we needed something innocuous, memorable, preferably with a payload of appropriately tasteless humour somehow opaque to everyone bar the tech ops. I remembered reading a list years previously, either on a BBS or USENET which I'd found morbidly amusing. Supposedly representative of a survey taken from Surgery magazine, of various objects removed from patients in emergency rooms, called the <a href="http://www.well.com/~cynsa/newbutt.html" rel="nofollow">
Rectal Foreign Bodies
</a>
<sup style="font-size:9px">[1]</sup> list. It was perfect, even coming with its own snazzy sounding cryptic Three Letter Acronym. The <strong>RFB</strong> cluster was born.</p>
<p>This scheme was successfully deployed for a few years, I think without the management types ever cottoning on to just why these innocent, random sounding computer names used to elicit such childish smirking and nodding between members of their technical staff.</p>

<p>Why? </p>
<ul>
<li>There's a TONNE of them.  </li>
<li>You'll never run out of names.</li>
<li>They're easy to Type:</li>
<li>FUJI, MAYON, EVEREST, K2</li>
<li><strong>Volcanoes</strong> are used for volatile servers</li>
<li><strong>Long mountain names</strong> like KILIMANJARO are servers that you don't want people to log onto</li>
<li>Different Mountain RAnges can serve as Clusters or a SAN. (The Rockies, Andes, Alps)</li>
<li>It's always the user's fault when they crash into a mountain
<ul>
<li><strong>Mountains</strong> don't crash</li>
</ul></li>
<li>However, sometimes they explode (VESUVIUS)</li>
<li>You can rank them by Height and represent many of them pictorially in Network diagrams. (The Matterhorn, Mt. Fuji)</li>
<li>Mountains are great Security fortresses (Why do you think China wants to keep Tibet... it's a plateau beside India!)</li>
<li>They are visible from outer space.</li>
<li>They can be classified in many different ways. </li>
<li>They can be Local (Intranet Servers) or in other countries/continents (WANs)</li>
<li>They are common to ALL people in all countries.  </li>
<li>They can be named after people's local hometown mountains. (When I was a kid I climbed to the peak of x mountain)</li>

                <p>I thought of two different naming schemes this week for a situation where there are redundant servers with one at a primary datacentre and its doppleganger at a secondary datacentre.  Each server would have a name that is related to its match.</p>

<p>Taurus / Sable</p>
<p>Cavalier / Sunfire</p>
<p>The problem there was deciding which was primary and which was secondary.  A better (and more fun) solution was superheros and their secret identities:</p>

<p>Spidey / Parker</p>

                <p>It may be worth referring to <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1178" rel="nofollow">
RFC 1178
</a>
<sup style="font-size:9px">[1]</sup>- "Choosing a name for your computer":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Naming groups of machines in a common way is very popular, and
           enhances communality while displaying depth of knowledge as
           well as imagination.  A simple example is to use colors, such
           as "red" and "blue".  Personality can be injected by choices
           such as "aqua" and "crimson".</p>
<p>Certain sets are finite, such as the seven dwarfs.  When you
           order your first seven computers, keep in mind that you will
           probably get more next year.  Colors will never run out.</p>
<p>Some more suggestions are: mythical places (e.g., Midgard,
           Styx, Paradise), mythical people (e.g., Procne, Tereus, Zeus),
           killers (e.g., Cain, Burr, Boleyn), babies (e.g., colt, puppy,
           tadpole, elver), collectives (e.g., passel, plague, bevy,
           covey), elements (e.g., helium, argon, zinc), flowers (e.g.,
           tulip, peony, lilac, arbutus).  Get the idea?</p>

                <p>I like systems that have a natural number-to-naming relationship, like the periodic table. Lots of cool names, and you can figure out IP addresses even when DNS is down (if you remember your chemistry).</p>
<p>There are other lists that work this way (50 states, US presidents, etc.), but the names aren't as cool.</p>

                <p>One place I used to work used Star Wars characters (there are thousands). It was a large company and so there was some initial competition over who got DARTH_VADER (the CEO), and DARTH_MAUL (the CFO) but eventually it settled down. When the time came to name the crash and burn test server which would get every evil piece of hackery thrown at it and need continuous rebuilding there was only one possible answer: JAR_JAR.</p>

              Goscinny and Uderzo had always done excellent translations of their jokes. The English versions were always spot on. Ex: Fulliautomatix the armorer, and his son Semiautomatix. One of the best I remember was a German named Electric, who vowed to become a general some day. Reading the comic in the original French was interesting for me years later, when I discovered the town wizard was named Panoramix.

<li>Gemini</li>

<p>And finally the best name of all time <strong><em>Uranus</em></strong>, getting calls about this server at 2 AM was hilarious.</p>
<p>After getting bored with that we starting making domains and each had a theme, and we would get bonus points if you could extend a name into another domain.</p>
<ul>
<li>Saturn planet - but also car, so then there was a car domain with lexus and camry.</li>
<li>Mercury - A planet but also a metal -> Zinc</li>
<li>Gemini - a planet but also a award so -> Oscar</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we expanded to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cheeses ( Jack, Cheddar, Feta ), </li>
<li>Trees ( elm, oak, maple ) , </li>
<li>Spaceobject and spacejunk ( mir, apollo, sputnik ) </li>

                <p>How about things not to name servers?  At one point all of our server names were Klingon.  </p>
<p>When I started at the company there was an instance where I needed to go into the server physically find a server.  It was difficult to understand Qlyah versus Quvalth over the noise of the server room while someone gave me directions over the phone.  It is also annoying to try to remote into a server if you have to look up how to spell its name.  I have been told that is my fault for not thinking in IP addresses.</p>

              I think it is your fault for not knowing klingon transcription.  &#39;tlh&#39; is a specific sound, and &#39;h&#39; does not exist in standard transcription (only &#39;H&#39;).  Also, klingon syllables follow a set pattern &#39;obligatory consonant&#39;-&#39;obligatory vowel&#39;-&#39;optional consonant&#39;. - <b> community_owned</b>

                <p>I once named a server 'pong' just so I'd have an excuse to type 'ping pong' from a command prompt. That alone brought me more amusement than any other server name I encountered.</p>
<p>A close second would probably be the company where we named all servers after sea creatures (a naming convention that was in place before I worked there). We had an extremely old server set up to accept incoming fax calls and forward the transmission as an attachment in an email. It was so slow during setup that it proved to be annoying. We named it 'deadfish'.</p>

                <p>At home all our computers and geeky devices are named after artificial intelligences: <strong>Wintermute</strong>, <strong>Neuromancer</strong>, <strong>Mother</strong>, <strong>Father</strong>, <strong>Bomb 20</strong>, <strong>Red Queen</strong>, but my most favorite is <strong>Fine Till You Came Along</strong>, the name of a mind ship in an Iain Banks science fiction novel.</p>
<p>At work we use the names of the districts in Frankfurt, like Bornheim, Niederrad, Harheim etc., but I think that's boring. At a previous employer at least all computers were named after Indian gods.</p>
<p>Much cooler is the naming scheme at a friend's company where all servers have names from gods in H.P. Lovecraft novels, like <strong>Cthulhu</strong>, <strong>Nyarlathotep</strong>, <strong>Shub-Niggurath</strong>, or <strong>Yog-Sothoth</strong>. Their name server is aptly named <strong>Alhazred</strong>. ;)</p>

              @Andrew Rollings: I&#39;d disagree with that assessment - how can it be an element in its own right if it is (as you state yourself) an arrangement of an element (carbon)? Would you consider diamond to be an element also? It is also an arrangement of carbon just like graphite is. Only those which are on the periodic table are elements. On a related note, I use elements from the PT for my own naming scheme. - <b> Splash</b>

                <p>Naming becomes difficult when you have more than 10 or so servers. What I've done in the past is give unique names to systems with specific duties, things like backup servers, mail servers, etc. The bulk of the systems get a location based prefix and a number. It makes scripting changes to the systems and keeping track of what you have much easier when you know you want to apply it to sea-001 thru sea-102 instead of remembering you ran out of Disney characters and switched to Firefly. </p>

<p>The Windows-based servers are named after Pokemons that tend to be bad: Seviper, Carnivine, Zangoose, etc. The other servers are named after Pokemons that tend to be good: Pikachu, Pachurisu, etc.</p>
<p>Also, our first virtual host was named after a Pokemon region, called Sinnoh. On Sinnoh, you could find Seviper, Pikachu, etc. A new mail server <em>had</em> to be named after Dragonite, who apparently was a messenger. Makes a weird kind of sense.</p>

                <p>I have used a wide variety of computer/peripheral naming conventions over the years, and I have always preferred pronounceable names as well.  I have used names from various mythos (Greek, Roman, Norse, etc.).  I have used planets.  I have used characters from a wide variety of movies, shows, series as well.  For example, I named my personal computers and peripherals after cartoon characters for a long time:  Taz, Tweety, Sylvester, Bugs, Daffy, Yosemite, etc.</p>
<p>However, I have always been frustrated when running out of names too quickly, especially when I started using virtual machines (VMs) a lot.</p>
<p>I started using mountains, but I found the list of usable names to be too short, and many of the names are too hard to type or pronounce.</p>
<p>Now I use the names of stars--there is a nice list on Wikipedia for reference, and there are LOTS of them that are usable.</p>
<p>So now I have Andromeda, Vega, etc.</p>

                <p>I use philosophers (and a few scientists). Well, the Master's degree in philosophy has to be useful for something. My laptop is called Ricoeur (after the French hermeneutic philosopher). Desktop machine is called Frege. Also: Gadamer, Darwin, Ayer, Davidson. I have a file on my laptop listing what any new machine gets called: Locke, Descartes, Heidegger, Russell, Sartre.</p>
<p>You can tell what operating system the machines are running by comparing their machine name to my attitude to the philosopher named. Linux/Unix/OS X machines are named after philosophers I like. Windows machines the opposite (Hegel - to quote Frederick Beiser's introduction to his book on Hegel: "Reading Hegel is often a trying and exhausting experience, the intellectual equivalent of chewing gravel" - a pretty good summary of my attitude to Windows). And routers, wifi access points etc. get named after ancient Greeks.</p>

                <p>Where I am now, we use relatively boring naming conventions which ends up being a huge bastardization of the server OS, purpose, site assigned to, etc. That being said, back in the day and when I have the freedom and creativity to assign server names, I used to keep two volumes of "Guide to Mathematicians and Physicists" on my desk and use those for names.</p>
<p>(Good lord, I just re-read that and realized just exactly how nerdy/geeky it is. :) `s ok I suppose, I'm comfortable in my nerddom.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Angstrom - exchange server 1</li>
<li>Keppler - exchange server 2</li>
<li>Dirac - exchange server 3</li>
<li>Fermi - Dev/QA mailserver</li>
<li>Avogadro - application hosting server</li>
<li>Bohr - license server</li>
<li>Turing - Dev/QA webserver</li>
<li>Curie - Domain Controller</li>
<li>Dyson - Linux application server</li>
</ul>
<p>...and wouldn't you know it that sometimes those servers would almost take on little quirky ways of behavior that almost in some ways matched that of their namesakes. :) </p>
<p>The again, was it us who was anthropomorphizing inanimate objects or guiding them in some way? :)</p>
<p>Also, since it makes sense to post it here. As a young uninitiated and recently out of the military starting helpdesk tech in California I remember being taken to our colo as part of the "wow" tour and seeing a successful web hosting company with a HUGE cage of mostly high-end sun servers that were labeled with weapon manufacturers as server names.</p>

                <p>This naming convention didn't work out very well but me and the sysadmin were big reggae fans and it was my first job out of college, (and it was a startup).  We used reggae artist names without spaces, seemed like a good idea at the time.</p>
<p>We had 
maytal, burningspear, congos, (my personal favorite) eek-a-mouse, heptones, wailers, pablomoses, augustuspablo, steelpulse and blackuhuru</p>
<p>Then one of the partners told us that blackuhuru "sounded offensive" so we renamed the servers by color, excluding the color black since we didn't want to be accused of being offensive.  Anytime I play Black Uhuru I can't help but laugh.  </p>

                <p>I'm not claiming it's the most awesome scheme, but it was fun for me. For quite a few years, I used the original names of streets in my neighborhood on the west side of Cleveland. It was a suburb long ago, and when Cleveland annexed the area they imposed a numbering system on the north-south streets and unduplicated the names of the east-west streets. Thus modern-day Mapledale Avenue, Archwood Avenue, and Denison Avenue translated into server names Maple, Greenwood, and Newburgh. West 25th and 33rd got servers named Columbus and Liberty. And so on.</p>

                <p>Where I work now, up until January every server and every workstation had a name (>300 machines here). When they died, they were replaced with new machines and new names.

                <p>In Ye Olde Days of Networks Yore (circa 1980), Digital Equipment Corporation had their DECnet software that made it so you didn't have to know the network topology.  You could just key in the name of the "server" and the DECnet software would figure it out.</p>
<p>I can't tell you how revolutionary this was.</p>
<p>DEC, being the 2nd largest computer maker, had a lot of facilities all over the world and they eventually tied them together with DECnet (which had the amazing capacity of 256 nodes for a while, then 1024!)</p>
<p>Major campuses and groups had their own schemes for naming their machines.  Mind you, sometimes you had to be creative because of 6-character limits on the node names.</p>
<p>In England they had ARTHUR (I thought they would add Arthurian-legend-based names) then added TRILLI, SLARTI, ZAPHOD and MARVIN.</p>
<p>Over at The Mill in Maynard, they were a bit more traditionally geeky with KIRK, SPOCK, MCCOY and SCOTTY</p>
<p>Once the people in one group got sick of names like VAX4 and VX1522, we got the RSX group with their little machines that kept going up and down with OS test builds - NORI, DORI, ORI, GIMLI, GLOIN, etc.</p>
<p>Sometimes groups wanted to name their machines after the codenames of their new hardware.</p>
<p>The original VAX was the "STAR" project.  So lot of VAXes got names after stars.  The next iteration was called "COMET" so we had machines called HALLEY, KHOTEK, and AJAX (think about that last one).  When the dual-processor ATLAS version came out, we had interesting pairs.  RAND and MCNALY was one I remembered.</p>
<p>Then you had ones that had to do with the particular group.  The Text Processing group had SCRIBE and QUILL.</p>
<p>Our group had one machine - we called it MERLIN (The Magic Vax!).  Unfortunately we had to run DEC's "office suite" called DECmail on it.  It was a HUGE memory hog that could bring a server to it's knees in nothing flat - everything was stored in a database written in an interpereted language called MUMPS.  In order to store unique identifiers for everything, part of the identifier was the first three characters of the node name of the machine where it was running.  We didn't want DECmail on our new system at all so we decided to name our 2nd machine "OZ".</p>
<p>Those were the days.</p>

<li>Reduces the awkward moments when you can't remember your boss' son's name. </li>

<ul>
<li>goku </li>
<li>vegueta </li>
<li>krillin </li>

I only remember a few offhand:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arachnephobia</li>
<li>Dementia</li>
<li>Ichthyophobia</li>
<li>Oedipus Complex</li>
<li>Xenophobia</li>
<li>Zoophobia</li>

<p>However, currently I'm working for a company with tens of thousands. At that point you need a decent naming scheme to make it easy and obvious to work out where a server is, what the server is, etc.</p>
<p>However, we have largely free reign over creating aliases to those servers which we map to the applications running on them. That way users, and us, get to browse to something memorable, and for DR purposes the aliases can be shifted automatically.</p>

<p>I always thought that was a great system.  After a while I think they ran out of Aborigine words and starting using names from Greek mythology (not sure why).</p>

                <p>When I went to university (Simon Fraser), our undergrad Computing Science lab's Sun workstations were all named after stars and constellations:</p>
<ul>
<li>pegasus</li>
<li>sirius</li>
<li>gemini</li>
<li>betelgeuse</li>
</ul>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>When the company that I work for first set up a network for their PCs (before they grew large enough to need an IT department), the servers were named after South Pacific islands:</p>
<ul>
<li>fiji</li>
<li>samoa</li>
<li>tahiti</li>
</ul>
<p>Sadly, once the IT department took over, our servers have always been given boring names like file1, file2, ..., mail1, etc. {sigh!}</p>
<p>I like to use planet/star system names from Larry Niven's Known Universe series:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ringworld</li>
<li>Smoke Ring</li>
<li>Jinx (haven't used this or any of the following yet)</li>
<li>Canyon</li>
<li>Mount Lookatthat</li>

                <p>I've been naming mine after Zerg units from Starcraft (nerd alert!).  So my towers were named Zergling, Hydralisk, and Ultralisk, respectively.  My router is named Overlord, my old laptop was Mutalisk, and the new laptop is Guardian.

                <p>I contracted with a large listed UK company a few years ago. The guy who'd grown their on line business had named everything some variant of Juan - Big Juan, Little Juan, Third One, Male Juan (the mail server). etc. Amusing yes but they were up to about 45 servers and essentially had random badly spelt names for everything.

<p>Seriously, we named all of the workstations after beers. And since it was a tech school, there were a great many computers. So we had jewels like smithwicks, smuttynose, courage, marriage-parfait, and girardin. They ended up calling my office machine asahi, since I was also in the school Anime club. </p>

                <p>I actually usually don't try to follow a set "theme," but instead, prefer all my hostnames to have SOME kind of story behind them.</p>
<p>My favorites were from the last company I worked at:</p>
<ol>
<li>We had just ordered a new server, and were having a heck of a time coming up with a clever hostname for it.  We were at a bar in Georgetown drowing our sorrow over the matter, when a typical Georgetown-Prep type (Dockers, sweater around his shoulders, you know the type) walks up with his date, leans over the bar, shooting the bartender a look you really had to see to appreciate, but it was as if he was trying to pretend he was a wannabe georgetown-prep type doing a poor imitation of a georgetown-prep type, with a sort of false swagger and air of righteousness about him.  Although if you looked at him, it was clear that HE didn't think he was pretending.  He then proceeds to say "Excuse me, can I have a collins?  Yes, a tom collins.  Yes, that will do."  At which point, my coworker and I instantly shoot each other an excited look and simultaneously yell "hostname"! :)  collins served us well, and was later joined by its counterpart behind a load balancer, which we named "tom" :)</li>
<li>This one also involved a bar, oddly enough... looking back, maybe we should have just named the machines things like "cirrhosis" :)  Anyway, there were these two incredibly attractive new waitresses at our favorite watering hole.  One blonde, one brunette.  The rest of the story doesn't really bear repeating in polite company, but our office was right across the street, we invited them over to play some guitar hero, a good time was had by all.  Just so happened we had ordered a new server and a new disk array... three guesses as to what the hostnames were :).  The punchline, though, was that I named the volume on brunette (the disk array) that stored backups "hand".  Which I thought was incredibly clever at the time.</li>

                <p>Sadly, no single IT person has lasted here more than a couple of years so the naming scheme has become... well, inconsistent. The most common one though is naming it after it's model. Like x206 for our IBM X206 or pe2950i for our Dell PowerEdge that stores Images. Since we're a smallish businesses, our servers have been bought one or two at a time so it works. I like this because, like with irrelevant names, we can repurpose the box without getting it's roles confused.</p>

                <p>Well my work is called Gamerz Arena and our little short name is GzA so most of the time it is just gzafileserv or gzafs but an old employee brought in this giant server that had a big box case that somewhat resembled a Borg Cube so we called it GzA-Borg. Nothing really cool or exciting but if we put up any new servers I will be sure to think up something neat sounding.</p>

<p>We had another machine that had services that would crash quite often, so we called it Kenny.  Thus, every time someone complained they couldn't get their generation report we would yell, "Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!"</p>

                <p>Back in the day, we named all of our servers after simpsons characters.  However, as the business grew, we were victims of our own success - while there are many many simpsons characters, once you've got hundreds and hundreds of servers, it becomes challenging.  So after having to say things like, "Moe17 is down" "Again?! Why can't moe17 be more like moe65", we decided that anything in a cluster or load-balanced pool would get a functional name, and only one-offs, like database servers, would be blessed with Simpsons names.</p>
<p>and for those people who name their servers based on their IP address...trust me, there will come a point at which you have to renumber your servers...and then you will see the pain you have just inflected on yourself.  Trust me.</p>

                <p>I just built a system to be a CCTV NVR (camera recorder) as well as it being the interface system for our building access control.  I named it O'Brien as a nod to the character that turns in Winston in 1984.  </p>
<p>Holy hell were people bitching and moaning when I was putting the camera system in.  It's something our clients wanted.  It is positioned not to focus on people at their desks, and it's not like anybody watches the thing.  It's there as a deterrent since we deal with multiple competing clients and sensitive equipment.  If something happens, then we can review the recording, that's it, argh.</p>

                <p>I'm a big fan of George Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire, and as such I name my stuff along that theme (with a particular bias towards House Targaryen, the local domain being targaryen.local)</p>
<p>My routers are named after places (dragonstone, valyria, winterfell, dorne)

<p>At work, we have <strong>[TLA of company]dbXX</strong>.

                <p>I like naming conventions that are nested so that it is easier to distinguish physical servers from virtual servers running as guests. </p>
<p>Wine Example:</p>
<p>Physical servers would be named after wine regions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Napa</li>
<li>Sonoma</li>
<li>Alexander</li>
<li>DryCreek</li>
</ul>
<p>While their virtualized guest machines would be named after types of grapes. If possible, pick a grape that has a similar spelling to the purpose of each machine.</p>
<ul>
<li>Viognier (VOIP server)</li>
<li>Malbec (Mail / Exchange server)</li>
<li>Primitivo (Print server)</li>
<li>Bacchus (Backup server)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many nested naming conventions to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Network / TV Show</li>
<li>Continents / Countries</li>
<li>Mountain Range / Mountains</li>
<li>Music Genre / Artist</li>
</ul>
<p>We would have a few nested naming conventions to distinguish production machines from development or testing machines. For example, while our production machines were named after wine-region/wine or development machines were named after country/cheese.</p>

<p>At a place I used to work, the Unix sysadmin started naming the Unix machines after people who'd left. He got away with it for a long time, too, until Unix started getting a profile -- we were a mainframe and mini-computer shop, for the most part. IIRC, the first to really break from tradition was calling the datawarehouse box 'jumbo' (I wanted to call it 'tarasque'). After I left, they got another one and called it 'fivedock' (there's a suburb in Sydney called Five Dock which used to be full of warehouses :-)</p>
<p>The company that bought us around this time had been using Unix boxes for things more than us. They were using Greek mythology for a while (how original). Then one new server got called 'hercules'. Remember: this was in the mid '90s. The next server in the same department got called 'xena'. The sysadmins were not amused. I believe there was a third that got called 'gabrielle' before too long.</p>

                <p>Not quite servers, I do name all of my devices that can be named, for instance, my G1 phone, with its protruding "chin", was named "Leno", but that broke so the iPhone 3GS I replaced it with became "Conan".</p>
<p>My desktop computer is named "Zero-One", after, well, binary.</p>
<p>My HP Pavilion dv2000 laptop, which has a wind pattern on its cover, is named "Zephyr".</p>
<p>My brother names his devices as if they were people, not making reference to anything: his laptop is named "Howard" and his Nintendo Wii is "Howie Jr."</p>
<p>And when I was in an after school video program in high school, we used to have a bunch of external hard drives that we'd store our footage on, and we'd come up with and vote on names for them all. My personal favorite? "Chocolate-Covered Peanut Butter-Filled Pretzels", after the always on-hand Trader Joe's snack, which of course then became abbreviated, however impractically, to "CCPBFP".</p>

                <p>We name our serves by hostclass, which means each host in that category solves the same purpose or has the same pkgs. Dbo, ldap, dns, mail, smtp nags(nagios) etc.( restrict to 4 characters)</p>
<p>So hostnames are like: <code>devldap100, devdns112, devsmtp899, stgnags120, prdmail292</code></p>
<p>template: &lt;3 letter env eg. dev, stg,prd>&lt;4 letter hostclass>&lt;3 0r 4 digits></p>
<p>Also note hosts with numbers less than 100 are testing i.e not ready for mass usage. Example: devldap003 is a test box.</p>
<p>If you have more than one project/product use domain differentiation like </p>
<pre><code>devexch192.iphone.domain.com

<li>Famine</li>
<li>Pestilence</li>

                <p>At the company I work at, they use islands. You will never ever run out of islands. You can also group clusters with island groups. Our firewalls are called Barbuda and Antigua. The server which produces munin graphs is called Algron, after the island Odin stayed for five years. :)</p>
<p>When I still lived at my parents, my dad started to call his server 'dog' and every workstation after that had a doggy name. Like the firewall was called guarddog, the computer with our first cd-burner was called hotdog and my computer was bulldog. So when I moved out, I took bulldog with me and started with dog breeds.</p>
<p>Somewhere in college I got two 19" 7u servers, they were big and heavy so I called them Akita and Mastino. My first laptop was called Chihuahua, my second laptop I named Draver. My manageable switches are called Bordercollie (that's the one with the internet uplink) and Beardedcollie.  My Sun Sparcstaion is called Dalmation, because Sparky the firemans dog is a dalmatian. :) I also have a nice quiet Sun Javastation, which I called Basenji, a dog breed that doesn't bark.</p>
<p>There was only one server that didn't have a real dog breed name, my first firewall that ran OpenBSD. The logo of OpenBSD is ofcourse a blowfish. In Dutch a seal is called a seadog (zeehond). So I thought it would be appropriate to call it seal. </p>
<p>I also hosted a server for the local university pub, so the first dog breed that I could come up with was Stbernard. 
The computers at the office of that pub are all called after beer, most of them Belgian beer. So we've got Koninck, Leffe, StilleNacht, Westvleteren, ...</p>
<p>When I installed a network at a youth camp, all computers were named after smurfs. The server was called PapaSmurf. </p>

                <p>I call all my private computers, servers, devices after Futurama characters:<br />

server - Fry  </p>

<p>At work, the servers are named like planets (uranus, etc.).<br />
From another project, the servers have random names like thunderstorm, deathrow, etc.<br />
Our clients servers are all named extremely boring and i notice that it's really harder to memorize what server you want to connect with when its called like mx01, mx02, etc.
It seems that clear names like mx01, mail01, web01 should be more memorizable and easier but from my experience speaking names are much better. I can still remember what was running on which server from years ago, whereas i still need to check up on the boring numbered names often enough.</p>

                <p>I once had an old HP server that was really noisy, it was
deployed in one of our office rooms and most users were
really pissed, when the box was up'n'running.</p>
<p>Because of its noise, it was named after the old nordic 
god of thunder: "Thor"</p>
<p>These days we have servers named after cats of prey like
- tiger, based on its Tyan "Tiger" mainboard..
- jaguar
- leopard</p>
<p>This was before we bought our first apple computer and 
realized that their OS releases were named like our servers. </p>

                <p>I used to use old 3&amp;486's for teaching myself linux and networking during college.  The naming scheme I used was: character names, no more than one name per source.  </p>
<p>The first one was Jefry (with one F).  Then Deckard (at the time, my brand-new P-II workstation).  Then Bilbo, Gonzo (the muppet), Hunter (the journalist), Raoul (the cartoon character), Angharad, Rathbone, and Wintermute (seems a popular name around here).  The last one in that scheme was Snowden, added in '01 or so.</p>
<p>Snowden's the only survivor of that bunch (and on basically the same hardware!).  Since then I've seen the movie with Alan Arkin, and Snowden's been joined by Yossarian, McWatt, Orr, Nately, Major, Daneeka and Dreedle.  </p>
<p>I only regret Yossarian. It's a pain to type.</p>

                <p>I've always used place names.  During the 80s, I worked for a company that imported Gucci and Fendi, and I named their computers (Prime superminis!) MILANO, TORINO, and VENEZIA.  </p>
<p>The shop I ran in Colorado, the servers were named Frisco, Leadville, Boulder, Aspen, etc.  This led to a lot of crude jokes pointed at the developer whose <em>wife</em> was named Aspen.</p>
<p>All of the machines in my home are named after Shadowfist cards, mostly feng shui sites:  <code>the_hub</code>, <code>proving_ground</code>, <code>kinoshita_house</code>, <code>inner_sanctum</code>, and this machine here is <code>quantum_sorcery</code>.</p>
<p>The last time I used Melvyl, the University of California's online card catalog, I saw, in some response, a server named <code>cerise.dla.berkeley.edu</code> or some such.  Which startled me, because I remember a friend of mine who worked at the Division of Library Automation showing me the list of colors that he'd compiled for server names, and that was in 1980.</p>

When we got around to renaming the servers as part of an effort to bring the entire district into a single Windows NT Domain, we named the servers using the Greek alphabet.  Alpha was the PDC and Beta, Delta, and Gamma were BDCs (located at remote sites), there were also additional servers named according to availability and location (Lambda was the server for the library).</p>
<p>The machine that I sat at had Windows 2000 Server on it.  It was named Xi.</p>

                <p>I worked for one project where the admins were "Trekists" (their term) and gave the database servers "Starship Enterprise" numbers in order of acquisition NCC-1701 through NCC-1701-C (I left the company before D and E were created)</p>
<p>When I started another project we were going to name the servers after planets, but the only one that had an obvious name was the tape backup machine (Uranus)  As soon as the boss heard someone yelling "take the tape out of Uranus" we had to rename the boxes.</p>
<p>Now we have boring names like Web-01, App-01, DB-01 and Mail-01</p>

<p>Also, my school had all the labs themed with different names for each machine.  One was the star wars room where you could work on Anakin, C-3P0, R2D2, etc. Another was the Tolkein room with Frodo, Gandalf, and the like.  If I remember right, we had the servers in the server room named after the ancient roman gods, though that was a while ago and I can't be sure of my memory on the servers (only saw them once or twice).</p>

                <p>Our latest batch of servers have been given beer names: Molson, Kingfisher, Corona, Spitfire, etc. This has the advantage that there are plenty to choose from.
</p><p>
Previously we have had software development machines named for stars: Rigel, Sirius, Algol, etc.  Plenty of those too.
</p><p>
CAD Workstations were named for rivers: from the exotic like Limpopo to the more local like Thames and Severn.  The backup server for these was Clyde, when it was later mirrored, its companion was called Bonnie.
</p><p>
Going way back, we once had just two DEC VAX-11/750s, one for development (DEVVAX) and one for pattern preparation used by the marketing department (MKTVAX).  These were later replaced by MicroVAXen called DADVAX and MUMVAX.  These were added to gradually, creating a cluster, but the children were given the prosaic names of AMVVAX, BMVVAX, etc.</p>

                <p>In my current company, our servers are not named according to any defined scheme but there are some interesting names like
</p><p>
Email Server = Cheetah<br />
Build Server = Bob the Builder<br />
DevServer = Digger etc<br />
Then there are other names like IGUANA, BAYBERRY, CHAMELEON, COBRA, DRAGON etc (Our network admin likes Animals for sure)</p>
<p></p>
But what is more interesting is the name of workstations. All the Dev workstations start with either a Busy prefix or a Crazy prefix like Busyb, Crazyd etc and all the QA workstations start with either a Dizzy prefix or a Lazy prefix.
<p></p><p>
At my old company, all the workstations were named to the names of the rivers around the world and every new person who joined the company had to choose an unused river-name from around the world for his machine. That really helped us increase our knowledge about rivers around the world :)

                <p>My home network uses a car theme, as I'm a bit of a car nut:</p>
<ul>
<li>PC: Corvette (big, powerful ... er, it was at the time)</li>
<li>My last PC: Eldorado (big, slow, outdated)</li>
<li>(old) Powerbook: Jaguar (sleek, sexy)</li>
<li>iPod: Mustang (big, powerful ... er, at the time)</li>
<li>Flash Drive: Miata (small)</li>

<p>The new Macbook I'm getting in a few weeks will probably be Fisker or Lotus. If I were getting one of the crazy expensive ones I'd name it Veyron or Spyker, but alas, that is not meant to be.</p>
<p>My girlfriend broke the scheme when she moved in. I believe her stuff is named after Shakespearean works ... </p>
<p>Obviously, our work network uses a more staid scheme. In ye olden dayes, prior to the new network team about 5 or 6 years ago, our servers were all named for basketball teams. (In fact, one still is: KINGS. But only because renaming it would be a PITA for various reasons.)</p>

When I was given the 1 minute tour of our facilities, I saw one machine under a desk in the "data center" with a photo copied picture of the head of a turtle taped to the side, poking out a few inches.</p>
<p>If you hadn't guessed already, the name of the server was "FatBastard".</p>

                <p>As far as naming schemes go, I like to go for NBA players, (though the concept extends any sort of athlete.)  They have the nice property of being grouped by team, and they have enough variability that one can use sports knowledge to infer relationships between entities. e.g. Garnett, Pierce, and Allen fit under the Celtics domain; Artest for a server that's not particularly stable etc.</p>

<p>I guess it depends on the size of your group.  I'm in an I.S. department of about a hundred people serving a company of over 6,000 with six major facilities and upteen small ones.  Our server names have two digits for which data center, then sequential.  And we are wishing we'd planned ahead and numbered them by rack and slot.

                <p>Many years ago i worked for a small shop.  The owner used to live on Eagle street, so his first server was named Eagle1.  The trend became to name servers after birds (Condor, Falcon, etc.)  Shortly after that, someone named their workstation after cartoon birds and that quickly followed.  I chose "Scrooge" for "Scrooge McDuck".  One day a client called me to report a problem with his website.  I uploaded the files, but the path to the image was hard coded from it being on my PC and I had to explain to him why "Scrooge" was part of the naming convention in his files and that it didn't refer to him.</p>

                <p>We used the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World (things in brackets are the serever names):</p>
<ol>
<li>Great Pyramid at Giza (Giza, Cheops, Khufu)</li>
<li>Temple of Artemis (Artemis)</li>
<li>Statue of Zeus (Zeus)</li>
<li>Colossus of Rhodes (Colossus)</li>
<li>Lighthouse at Alexandria (Pharos)</li>
<li>Hanging Gardens of Babylon (Babylon)</li>
<li>Mausoleum at Halicarnassus (Halicarnasus)</li>
</ol>
<p>We're on to our 3rd server named after the Great Pyramid, so we've used all three names.  </p>
<p>The one that stumped us was the last one.  No one wants to type it in.  So we used it for the fax server, which because of the software hides the name from all the users.</p>
<p>When we added more servers we had lots of other things that aren't official wonders that we thought should count:  Stonehenge, Sphinx, Colosseum, stuff like that.</p>
<p>Then we got bored and started using Egyptian gods (Anubis, Horace, Set, Ptah and so on).  A lot of them are hard to pronounce, so we've moved on to Norse gods.  I think we have a Thor, a Loki and an Odin.</p>
