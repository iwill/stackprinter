          <p>Where as a developer do like to you keep your code snippets, links, checklists, final solutions to problems etc?  </p>
<p>I've fooled with Google Notebook, MS Onenote, TreePad, textfiles, and Evernote a bit (currently leaning toward Evernote).  All have pros and cons but none seem to be really suited to developers.  Is anyone super-happy with a collection / note system that's not just generic GTD, but with developer-centric utility?</p>

                    What don&#39;t you like about using OneNote? It&#39;s what I use, and the only issue I would have is color coding code. Other than that, it seems to be quite easy to access my saved notes. Might also wanna get AutoHotKey so you can open it with a keyboard shortcut, so it less time spending looking for the program and more on adding the snippet.

                <p>I like physical notebooks. Preferably small ones (4x6 or 5x8, not 8.5x11), permanently bound (spiral bound, book binding, etc.). </p>
<p>One notebook per project, typically, unless they're really small projects, in which case I reach for a partially used notebook and add to it.</p>
<p>I find it very helpful to grab a notebook off my shelf and re-read my maunderings from when I was thinking my way through something. Scribbling on paper lets me record partial thoughts instead of doing a 'finished' write-up. This lets me revisit my thought process in addition to the solutions I found -- and that tends to be more enlightening than merely recording a solution.</p>
<p>UPDATE: I'm extremely gratified at the response of my peers to this simple answer, and so I thought perhaps I should elaborate on my methods.</p>
<p>First off, I find the typical Moleskine notebooks to be too small, and they tend to be expensive. I usually use something like <a href="http://www.staples.com/office/supplies/p1_Steno-Memo-Notebooks_98429_Business_Supplies_10051_SC1:CG10:CL140571" rel="nofollow">
this one from Staples
</a>
<sup style="font-size:9px">[1]</sup>.</p>
<p>Top of each page: Project name, Page number, and Date I started writing on this page.</p>
<p>Daily: Draw a line across the page, and write the current date (and sometimes the time) down before adding more notes. It's helpful to see the gaps of time in working out ideas. And I often find my best ideas turn up just below one of these lines -- that is, after I've thought for a while and come up with something.</p>
<p>Review and Redact: If I've written out a few ideas of directions to go, and later I decide on one of them, I make sure to go back to the original list of ideas and add notes; specifically, I'll hilight the chosen solution somehow (underline, circle, etc.), and add a reference to the new page where I wrote down <em>why</em> I chose this solution.  Also, I try to make these revision notes in a different color ink, or written at a different angle, or make them in some other way obviously not part of the old information.</p>
<p>Reference: If I flip back to look at something, I consider jotting down 'see pg. 13' so I don't have to go flipping around for that information again.  I also never hesitate to refer to other project notebooks, noting them with 'See proj. Alpha, pg 23' or something similar. Sometimes I backlink that notebook as well, say in Alpha pg 23 a note 'Very helpful for proj Beta pg 7!'. These sorts of notes across projects are fairly rare.</p>
<p>I'm sure I've left out some of my other ideas and techniques. Perhaps others could add their ideas and techniques here as well? I know I'd appreciate hearing them!</p>

              I agree 100%. It&#39;s also crucial to keep it all in a notebook, especially for people who have poor organization skills. How many times have I seen a coworker look desperately for a sheet of paper they wrote something important on. That being said, these people might lose the notebook altogether :D - <b> Gilles</b>

              Wow... Physical notebook for code snippets? And links!? Do you really copy your code from screen to paper by hand-writing?

              Problem with this answer is that it answers a different question that has been asked here. You are all writing about general note taking, for which the physical notebook is quite good. But the question is about keeping: snippets, links, checklists, final solutions to problems etc. For which is the &#39;hardware&#39; notebook unusable at all. - <b> Josef Sábl</b>

              @Josef: Yes, I really write code in notebooks. However not <i>all</i> code, just important or complex stuff. I find it that since I write slower with a pen than with a computer the time it takes allows me to better reflect what I&#39;m doing and thus improve my real (as in digitally typed) code. It might be a little crazy but I&#39;ve seen a couple of developers and even more designers do this, and they are usually quite good in what they do. The longest snippet I wrote in a notebook was a DB wrapper and it took about 120 lines. - <b> Alix Axel</b>

              I&#39;ve been writing notes down on paper for as long as I remember. My room is filled with papers and little notes. Despite my futile attempts to regularly clean my room and sort organise the notes, I cannot seem to keep it neat for long. So now I&#39;ve ordered a Moleskin!

                <p>Start a blog. This way, not only you benefit, but so do others who may have the same problem. There are also combination blog/wiki systems, ranging from <a href="http://drupal.org/" rel="nofollow">

<sup style="font-size:9px">[1]</sup> to <a href="http://hikiwiki.org" rel="nofollow">

<p>Oh, and some people really like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mind_mapping_software" rel="nofollow">
mind maps

<sup style="font-size:9px">[3]</sup> for brainstorming and such, but I'm not sure that they're that valuable for long-term note taking/storage.</p>
<p>UPDATE: If you don't really want to run your own site, or a blog is too much of a time investment, another option is to start posting on <a href="http://refactormycode.com" rel="nofollow">

              The blog is a good idea, but I always shied away from it because of confidentiality issues.  Its an extra step of mental effort to take your ramblings and &#39;generify&#39; them, such that you&#39;re not actually disclosing your employer&#39;s work product on the internet. - <b> GWLlosa</b>

              There is a fine line on the blog though, to make it useful to you (potentially confidential code snippets), and useful to others (listing test cases, workarounds for not project relevant items). It&#39;s disadvantage is you are writing notes for someone else too - the web. - <b> SuperRoach</b>

              If all you need is a note to say something like &quot;{some construct} - unexpected bad perf; use {other construct} instead&quot;, splitting off to then write a blog is an interruption in the train of thought. If you write a lot of notes, then working out what you then need to blog about just ends up eating into otherwise productive time. - <b> Chris J</b>

<p>It's great all your notes get cross referenced.</p>
<p>TiddlyWiki is a single HTML file which contains all the articles ("tiddlers") for a small wiki.  It also contains all the styling and javascript to make it work as a wiki (displaying / hiding articles, generating menus, etc).  Fans find it a very intuitive way of constructing a document.<br />
... although it's not just a document - one might almost say it's a tiddly wiki!  </p>

<p>The only problem is how to keep it in sync in multiple locations.<br />
Possible solutions are: </p>

<li>keep it on a flash drive</li>

              @Chris S, saying it requires 2 files is also a &quot;bit of a lie&quot;.  It depends on entirely the browser you use.  Firefox and IE work perfectly with just a single html file.  Opera, Safari require the Tiddlysaver add-in (which is a jar, from memory). - <b> Ash</b>

              TiddlyWiki works well with Firefox and doesn&#39;t require a .jar file.  But getting Firefox to always save without that annoying warning is a bit fiddly.  After saying yes to the warning at least once, you need to (1) <i>exit Firefox</i>, (2) open your prefs.js file (somewhere like C:\Users\yourUserName\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles).  (3) Look for three lines that contain <code>capability.principal.codebase.p0</code>.  (4) In the line that has <code>capability.principal.codebase.p0.id</code>, change the second argument to point to your TiddlyWiki file (e.g. &quot;file:///C:/dir/dir2/TiddlyWiki.html&quot;).

              OneNote is fantastic.  It&#39;s the only MS product I like, but it&#39;s great.  It beats paper and pencil because 1) it can be searched, 2) it can be backed up, 3) you can insert in something you&#39;ve already written, 4) sensitive entries can be encrypted, 5) one can easily make cross-reference links, etc, etc.  I use it on a tablet, and it&#39;s great, for example, for deriving equations, as you can write the equation with the pen, and then type a paragraph of descriptive text, and insert a link from the web.  I wish it was available for Linux, as it&#39;s the only reason I use Windows. - <b> tom10</b>

                <p>Depending on the nature of the project and the size of your development team, a number of methods are necessary to adequately cover all of the bases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paper Notebook (for personal day-to-day notes)</li>
<li>Dedicated Bug-Tracking App (because it's too important to not be its own thing)</li>
<li>Wiki (for internal documentation within your team or department)</li>
<li>Blog (to keep a journal of your growth as a developer)</li>
<li>Forums (for team discussions and Q&amp;A)</li>
</ul>
<p>For day-to-day notes, reminders, and sketches, I still haven't found anything as good as an old-fashioned pen &amp; paper notebook.  Part of the beauty of this solution is that your notebook can be as organized or as chaotic as suits your style.  I don't think there is any best way to use a notebook.</p>
<p>A wiki is great, but I find that in order to get the most out of it, it has to be a common wiki used by everyone on the team or in the department.  <a href="http://www.tiddlywiki.com/" rel="nofollow">
TiddlyWiki
</a>
<sup style="font-size:9px">[1]</sup> is an excellent piece of software, but it is designed for individual use.  You want something more like <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/" rel="nofollow">
MediaWiki
</a>
<sup style="font-size:9px">[2]</sup> that can be set up on a central server.</p>
<p>The focus of your <strong>wiki</strong> should be on <strong>practical documentation</strong>.  It should be rife with FAQs, tutorials, How-To articles, sample code, and so forth.  Ideally, any time somebody on your team hits a stumbling block and has to learn something specific to your company or project, they should contribute an article to the wiki about it.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid email for documenting things</strong> such as gotchas and best practices.  Many people tend to reach for email when they first identify a recurring problem and want to publicize the solution.  The problem is that email tends to be hard to find weeks later, which is when the problem being discussed will most likely resurface.  The best thing to do is to write a wiki article and then send an email to publicize the article.  A good wiki will have a much better signal to noise ratio than a typical email inbox.</p>
<p>A <strong>blog</strong> is a useful tool for <strong>personal development</strong> and communicating your experience to other developers.  However, writing a good blog tends to be a lot of work, and may prove to be too much of a distraction within a software development team.  Also, blogs lack the hierarchy that a wiki has; they capture information in chronological order, and therefore suffer from the same issues as an email inbox to a small degree.</p>
<p>If your team or department is large, a forum might be a useful alternative to email, and may also be a convenient dumping ground for transitory topics that don't belong in a wiki.  A <strong>forum</strong> can be a useful place to track <strong>fire-fighting</strong> style issues that occur suddenly, affect many team members, and may require some discussion or exploration.  It can also be a place to post light-hearted stuff such as funny web links or other topics that team members use to blow off steam.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the most important things to have are the paper notebook, the bug-tracking DB, and the wiki.  Blogs and forums are good to have, but not as effective for capturing simple, straight-forward documentation.  So far I haven't found any single piece of software that is effective enough to replace a combination of individual notebooks combined with a central wiki and a central bug database.</p>
<p>It should also go without saying that your project should use some sort of version control software. :)</p>

<p>DokuWiki is is targeted at developer teams and mainly aimed at creating documentation of any kind.

Optional syntax highlighting of code blocks is another neat feature most programmers find useful.</p>

                <p>I find that the <strong>less time spent</strong> on the tool the <strong>better</strong>.  I often have 2 files going: ideas.rtf and todo.rtf.

The reason I bring up the format and not the editor is because my notes then end up being portable and editable by almost any tool .</p>

                <p>We use FogBugz, and all notes from the dev team go into the wiki. There are also general engineering/networking questions, and they go into an engineering wiki.</p>
<p>This way, even quick notes are found in one place and last forever. And you have the added benefit of being able to easily correct or update older notes.</p>

                <p>I've been programming for over 20 years and sadly I have had the same problem as the OP, until I discovered the LiveScribe pen this year.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.livescribe.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.livescribe.com/</a></p>
<p>It has totally changed my note-takeing life! It has 4 main benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>It's a pen.  At the end of the day it's a pen, so you can scribble/doodle/write notes, just as you always do...but...</li>
<li>It's a RECORDING pen.  When you dock the pen with your Mac/PC, it uploads what you've written and then OCRs it! And the OCR is remarkable.  I have THE worst handwriting I've seen.  Really, it's terrible, yet this thing nails it every time.  Which leads me to...</li>
<li>Your rantings are searchable.  Because everything is OCRd, you can actually find what you scribbled a year ago.  This means as you fill up more and more pads, you can always find what you want.</li>
<li>(this is beautiful) You can tap 'record' and scribble a mark anywhere you want on a page, and start talking out loud (like a dictaphone).  At any point in the future, you just tap your scribble on any page and the recording is played back instantly.  All of the audio is uploaded to your Mac/PC upon docking the pen too.  This is pure gold, and frankly is the killer feature for me.  I can actually think out loud while I'm writing, or record a meeting and go back to what was said at any point.  So incredibly useful.</li>
</ol>
<p>I honestly can't recommend this enough.  It's like GPS for me; once you've used it, you can never go back!</p>

                <p>I have a directory called "notes" with just three sub folders, unix, java and confs (for working config and property files). It is backed up in subversion and mirrored between my laptop, work laptop, work desktop and my server. Many of the files have names like "find-command-examples.txt" , "cusip-validate-via-regex.txt" or "jboss-jndi-with-openldap.txt" </p>
<p>Plain text is the way to go. And fewer folders is better since you don't waste time deciding if something should go into "unix", "shell" or "scripts" </p>
<p>On my Mac I use spotlight to search. On unix I use grep. On windows I use the cygwin find command.</p>
<p>If you need formating, consider rtf since you'll still be able to grep. Or use find with rtf2txt to keep plain text versions.</p>

                <p>After 25+ years as a developer, many of them spent writing notes (I'm an inveterate scribbler) I'm really <em>over</em> paper notes.</p>
<p>They are bulky, you can't search them, can't back them up and can't carry them around that easily.</p>
<p>Modern OS, especially OS/X which I use as my main desktop, are really good at finding things so the most important thing is just <strong>write stuff down.</strong> You can worry about getting the <em>where</em> right later. That's also a lesson for wiki users - we had a very successful wiki (using Twiki) at CSIRO where I worked with many scientists and the number-one lesson was to record now, edit later.</p>
<p>Having said all that, I'm naturally a tactile and then visual thinker. I tend to sketch solutions. To keep everything searchable, simple, diffable and able to be used in a wiki and in Doxygen, I do many of my diagrams with GraphViz. That way I just have to describe the diagram in a simple text form and the picture is generated. I use GraphViz (strictly, the dot tool) for schema documentation, calling sequences and casual architecture diagrams because it's the fastest possible way to get a picture recorded.</p>
<p>As a self-education and self-improvement excercise, whilst it is useful and fun to be able to leaf through past notes in a notebook, I think it is actually better to be actively editing and commenting on past work. I think you're more likely to lay down new associations in your brain if you're <em>handling</em> the material by pulling bits out and writing them up or classifying them in relation to other bits of knowledge. This is also one thing you can do to mitigate the linear style of blogs - maintain index pages pointing to your better postings.</p>

                <p>I find it surprising that nobody has mentioned the notes built-in support in Opera. You can access the notes whenever you're browsing with a shortcut (Ctrl-Alt E), which will prompt you to the notes tab searchbar, You can even synchronize your notes so that you'll only have one big repository of notes in any Opera browser that you use, thus you can be in Linux, Windows, Mac and still read your notes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I use it all the time whenever I can't recall how I did something before but that I have a hunch that I might have made a note for it, I just bring the notes from Opera and type whatever I can remember from that note, and voila! &nbsp;There it is.
<br />Although, it could be said that one of the drawbacks of Opera notes is that you can't format your text. </p>

                <p>Ok, this is a mac-centric answer...</p>
<p>I used to use <a href="http://flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/" rel="nofollow">
voodoo pad
</a>
<sup style="font-size:9px">[1]</sup>, which is a desktop wiki program.  It's quite nice to
use because it's a fully integrated mac app.  You can copy and paste rich text into
it and preserve the fonts and formatting and so forth.  It's really pretty nice to
be able to dump procedures, notes, stuff you received in email and so forth.  And
it has a great search feature.</p>
<p>One thing I should note -- I initially bought this application because I thought I
could have a nice-to-edit desktop wiki, and be able to access it remotely through
a webserver/wiki type interface.  It never lived up to the hype though.  Maybe it's
better now.</p>
<p>Then I used <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/" rel="nofollow">
Omni Outliner
</a>
<sup style="font-size:9px">[2]</sup>.  This had many of the great qualities of Voodoo pad,
but would allow me to hide and rearrange things.  It gave me the ability to prioritize
stuff, and conversely, hide unimportant stuff.  And search too.</p>
<p>Now, I'm using <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/" rel="nofollow">
Omni Focus
</a>
<sup style="font-size:9px">[3]</sup>.  The <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com" rel="nofollow">

out with Omni Outliner, so I switched.
It does most of the stuff Omni Outliner does, but with all the <a href="http://www.davidco.com/" rel="nofollow">
Getting Things Done (GTD)
</a>
<sup style="font-size:9px">[5]</sup>
goodies that helps you manage the tasks.</p>
<p>To be honest, I haven't really taken advantage of the OmniFocus extras, but it's
part of the plan...</p>

EverNote
</a>
<sup style="font-size:9px">[1]</sup> for general note management.</p>
<p>The older I get, the less information I seem to be able to retain, and I’m finding it increasingly necessary to write things down so I can reference them later. Since it seems I have forgotten how to use a pen or pencil to make legible characters on a piece of paper, I usually type this information into the computer. I have tried a number of ways to organize these digital "sticky notes". For awhile I was using the Notes feature in Microsoft Outlook , but that doesn’t really allow me to access my notes wherever I am, and it was awkward to use. I discovered I could use Yahoo! Notepad to sync with Outlook Notes, so I began to use that quite a bit - until I moved to Vista and Office 2007. For a long time, there wasn’t a sync client from Yahoo! that would work, and I found myself looking at other alternatives. A couple of weeks ago I discovered an application that is really working well for me. Evernote describes itself this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Evernote allows you to easily capture
  information in any environment using
  whatever device or platform you find
  most convenient, and makes this
  information accessible and searchable
  at any time, from anywhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What’s nice about Evernote is that it is provides a Windows client that synchronizes with a web interface, so your information is truly available to you wherever you go. There are Mac, Windows Mobile, and IPhone clients as well.</p>
<p>This is not just for text. There is a simple rich text editor for taking notes in meetings or entering the bits of information you need to do your job or manage your life. Beyond that, you can store entire web sites (or just selected portions) quite easily using a Firefox extension. The program will also store scanned images, PDF files, and audio clips, but I haven’t really taken it that far.</p>
<p>Searching works well, and they claim to also search PDF files and text within images. Like Outlook Notes and Yahoo! Notepad, each note is assigned a title based on the first line. Evernote, however, allows you to rename the title. Notes can be organized into folders and assigned tags.</p>
<p>Synchronization also works well - even behind the firewall at work (it appears to use whatever HTTP proxy is configured in Internet Explorer). By default it syncs once an hour, but this is configurable, and you can force a sync at any time. I haven’t really tried using the web client. I have the Windows client running in the system tray so it quickly accessible.</p>
<p>Did I mention it was free? There is a monthly cap, but in my regular use I am not even coming close to the allotted upload allowance. The premium version is $45/year, which gives you SSL encryption as well as a much larger upload allowance.</p>
<p>If you are like me and need an application that will allow you to create your own personal knowledgebase , than I highly recommend Evernote .</p>

                <p>I regularly use Emacs and org-mode for note keeping.  Its flat text format is easy to post in emails, diff with text processing tools, store in SCM systems in a meaningful manner, and so on.  The nice UI shortcuts to add new 'note nodes', promote notes, demote notes, move them around, expand and collapse them, and the almost free-form style of the note text is nice when one spends a lot of time editing text (documentation, sources, etc).</p>

                <p>Four things give me the ability to record and find every note I need for a software project.</p>

<li>A <strong>text editor</strong> I know by heart. This incudes <code>vim</code> &amp;TextMate, but there's no reason you can't be proficient at <code>emacs</code>, Notepad 2, TextPad, or BBedit. I'm looking forward to learning <code>sam</code>.</li>
<li>A <strong>search tool</strong> I know by heart. This tends to be <code>grep</code>, <code>find</code>, and Quicksilver.</li>
<li><strong>Automated tests</strong>. I prefer a behaviour driven development framework like <code>rspec</code>.  Ideally you can generate documentation from those tests, saying which pass, which fail, and which are pending or ignored.</li>
<li><strong>Version control</strong>. If you don't have a record of when you create and edit your notes, you'd have to do that yourself. I suggest Subversion, <code>svn</code>, or Mercurial, <code>hg</code>.</li>

There&#39;s a band which keeps it closed and a bookmark to keep your current position. So yes, I&#39;m a moleskine convert. - <b> tovare</b>

                <p>Simplest tools are best.  I used notebooks for a long time, but got frustrated by no being able to search for stuff or take them your notes with you. Used OneNote on a tablet pc for a while. Has a lot to recommend it, but the notes are stuck on one PC (OneNote can actually share stuff around, but it's a bit fiddly) and tablets are expensive underpowered and short on battery life.</p>
<p>My primary thinking tool is a whiteboard and a digital camera.</p>
<p>I now use FogBugz - the combo of case tracking and wiki is very powerful.  You can keep all your stuff in it. Easily re-work material into specs and docs. Share material with co-workers and create cases when it comes time to actually do something.  And full-text search lets you find it.</p>

                <p>Honestly I keep notes on projects, solutions and other notes in a more traditional fashion.  I use a moleskine notebook, personally.  I originally used a piece of personal wiki software called "Notebook".  It works like just about any other wiki but it lacks image support and table support.  However I found it was a hassle to add information. I'd spend way too much time formatting the information and get sidetracked from my main task.  With a traditional notebook, I spent far less time formatting, and more time jotting down what I needed and resuming my work.</p>
<p>The main website seems to be down so I'll simply post the Wikipedia article about the software. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notebook_(software)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notebook_(software)</a> I do highly recommend it if you do want a wiki approach with a small footprint.</p>

                <p>I have 2 large physical notebooks.</p>
<p>One has "Reference" written on the front, and one has "Work" written on the front.</p>
<p>The Reference notebook I use for general study notes, or things I come across which I think it would be useful to remember in future (e.g. notes on JQuery or OO principles). I write a page number at the top of every page, and maintain a "Contents" list on the first page. If something comes into my head which I think it would be useful to learn about, I add it to a list on the back page, and then when I have some free time I pick an item from this list to read up and take notes on.</p>
<p>The Work notebook I use for more project-specific notes (e.g. brainstorming on a project design, or drawing up a task list). Again I number every page and maintain a contents list on the front page, although this contents list only includes references to important pages.</p>
<p>When I reach the end of a Reference / Work book, I start another one!</p>
<p>The best thing about this method is its simplicity, and its easier to mind-map / draw diagrams in a notebook than through your computer.</p>

                <p>I have a glass desktop and I use wet-erase markers for all of my transient notes. I used to use dry-erase but they would rub off as things would slide across the desk. Not so with wet-erase.</p>
<p>If I really really need to keep the notes for posterity, I take a picture with my digital camera. I've only had to do this a couple times.</p>

                <p>My memory is horrible. When I took my current job, I created an Access database to handle my notes. I've got links to documents and websites. Names of different servers. Copies of expense reports. The Bio I sent the HR Dept. There are code sample and SQL scripts.</p>
<p>It's searchable. Date stamped. I can write any report I want. It is nothing fancy. The key is, I work with Access a lot, so it was not that hard to build, manage and use.</p>
<p>If you want something that is accessible from the web, your phone, computer etc. I think 'Evernote' is one of the best products out there. It is everything I would want in a note app. I'm still learning more. The cell phone camera upload is perfect.</p>

                <p>Tomboy combined with Gnome-Do. Part of Gnome on Ubuntu. It's not developer specific, but it's unreasonably useful, and integrates with Do brilliantly. I press Ctrl-Space, type some stuff, press tab, type note and then go to create or search, and it searches all my notes for that text, and brings up a list of results, or it creates a new one with that title. Works perfectly, and keeps everything indexed, which is a real problem I've always had with making paper notes. Where's the bit with my plans for this bit?</p>
<p>Also, you can combine this with dropbox with a bit of neat symlinking, and have all your notes kept in sync (with revision control) on all your computers, and backed up to the internets. Beautiful.</p>

                <p>I like it simple:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Text Files (edited with PSPad or UltraEdit).</strong> I have conventions for marking headings, todo items, or simple bulleted items. My personal time log is also recorded in the text files, and log the day's notes under each day section. They are easy to backup, viewable by many applications, easily searchable. Plain Text Files feel natural like coding itself.</li>
</ol>
<p>PSPad or UltraEdit helps in keeping your notes properly formatted (indentation). It's easy to move code snippets around. </p>
<p>With text files you don't have to deal with formatting, but you can use TiddlyWiki if formatting matters. </p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>During meetings or discussions I use real notebooks.</strong> If I am bringing my laptop, I use my text files. If using notebooks, I record important information into my text files, too.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Firefox bookmarks synchronized online.</strong> I organize my Internet references using folders and/or tags. I make sure the bookmark title is very descriptive, so that you can take advantage of Address Bar search when accessing them again.</p></li>

www.ubernote.com
</a>
<sup style="font-size:9px">[1]</sup>, which I have been working as a part of for the last two years.  Ubernote has been coming along very quickly recently and gives me just about everything I need.  Users of Microsoft OneNote or EverNote will conceptually understand the application, just about any user of an email client will understand the interface.  I know I am an Ubernote evangelical, but working there, I have become pretty passionate about it.  Using Ubernote, I can write notes in an editor similar to this one, share them with other people (normally coworkers or my girlfriend), add comments, clip web pages using the Firefox toolbar or bookmarklet, tag, search, etc.  I use it to clip a lot of reference material and then look it back up later.  Saves me from having to do a Google search for every nugget of information that took 20 minutes to find and I need to remember again.</p>
<p>Even though I write note taking software, I still can't fully give up my paper notebooks, for the common instances of:</p>
<ol>
<li>I'm sick of sitting in front of the computer and my eyes are bugging out.</li>
<li>Taking a step back from the problem and writing it out on paper makes the solution easier.</li>
<li>I want to do some drawings.</li>

  you can search it in an instant, as if
  it’s all written on the back of your

Scrivener
</a><sup style="font-size:9px">[2]</sup></strong>, "The biggest software advance for writers since the word processor." I've found it more motivating to maintain good notes as the tool itself is designed prepares your work for publication.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scrivener is a word processor and
  project management tool created
  specifically for writers of long texts
  such as novels and research papers. It
  won't try to tell you how to write -
  it just makes all the tools you have
  scattered around your desk available
  in one application.</p>
<p>Never be afraid to make mistakes.
  Scrivener's "snapshot" feature makes
  it easy to return to an earlier
  version of your text. Before starting
  a major edit on a document, just take
  a snapshot, which stores the old
  version safely away. You can then call
  up old snapshots for reference, or
  restore an older version of the text
  if you decide you prefer it to the
  most recent revision.</p>

                <p>Solution: (USB Flash Drive and Notepad++)</p>
<p>Notepad++ is a text editor that highlights many of the popular languages. It's also portable. I can run it off my USB flash drive which is on my key chain so it's with me all the time. I can organize my files in whatever way I need to and I have access to it even when I'm not connected to the internet. </p>
<p>It's not as glamorous as some of these other solutions, but it's a free solution that works for me. The only thing con is the fact that you've got to have a USB port for this solution, so that means no iPod Touch access. But how many times am I actually going to be coding on my iPod Touch? And if I happen to think of something I need to add to my notes and I don't have a computer or laptop around I can email it to myself and save it on my flash drive later.</p>

                <p>The combination of OneNote with a tablet PC is awesome!  I was a bit of a skeptic at first.   I used the trial version and then forgot about it.   A year later I had an unruly collection of files, project related emails, notebooks and scraps of paper all scattered throughout my life.  I went back to OneNote and all my problems went away.  Some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Everything</strong> is searchable.  The character recognition is good enough that my chicken-scratch meeting notes can be searched.  Text within images is searchable.</li>
<li>OneNote syncs with Outlook so finding meeting notes is a breeze.</li>
<li>I now embed all files into OneNote - pdfs, spreadsheets, word docs, images, web clippings.</li>
<li>OneNote is constantly saving all changes so, combined with a scheduled automated backup, everything is in one place and is safe.</li>
<li>There are some built-in collaboration tools I have yet to try but that look useful.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is <strong>SO</strong> worth the price.  It allows you to get started on a project and avoid all that time spent deciding how to organize things.</p>

                <p>What a great question...</p>
<p>I use paper notebooks for most of my notes, which I try to keep sorted in binders or folders for future reference. Notes eventually evolve into project documentation, which usually fits in some kind of wiki-form. Classic Word-like documents are a no-no in my opinion.</p>
<p>Any structured e-paper-based approach failed for me. It's overly complicated and it's not portable after all. I do use, however, desktop post-it notes which are excellent for keeping code snippets, to-dos and such.</p>

                <p>Another emacs fan here. I generally start most notes out in OrgMode.  It provides a nice outline style that still allows for free form notes as well. It's also nice because as I identify things that need to be done I can mark them as TODO, schedule them and have them show up in an agenda type view of things to do.  Additionally you can set a deadline on them as well which will then make the item show up earlier in the agenda with a count down of when it should be done.  I am also a fan of EmacsMuse which among many other things is a personal wiki.  There is also some tie in between the two packages I believe that will allow you to publish both org and muse files to html/xml/rss/pdf...  Both also can make use of remember mode.  </p>

                <p>1) A good text editor with a hierarchical outliner mode (e.g. Emacs + org-mode, or vimoutliner).
why? Because programming involves drilling down into increasingly precise statements of the original task.</p>
<p>2) Your revision control system of choice and local checkout of the source code
why? Because the most precise definition of the task usually is code; leaves fall off the Todo Tree and into the tree of source code. </p>
<p>Text files, a GNU userland and revision control go together like coffee, milk and sugar, and this arrangement gives you the flexibility and freedom to adopt new tools as you choose.</p>

                <p>Like previous posters, I also use TiddlyWiki for my notetaking needs. I will expound on why, from a programmer point of view.</p>
<p>First, note that "tiddler" is a note object in TiddlyWiki parlance. </p>
<p>Each medium to large project gets a TiddlyWiki file all to its own. The default tiddlers are an overall project overview, and a "master" class that links to other objects. Each object has notes about that specific class or object, things that work or don't work, etc. Most of this ends up being in classes, but as we all know, there's additional notes we take while writing code, including external libraries and supporting programs.</p>

                <p>I use Wikis as much as possible.  I find that it helps for a number of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>I can take the Wiki with me from job to job.</li>
<li>I run the wiki locally on my development PC, so it's available from anywhere on my corporate intranet.</li>
<li>When people ask me questions I've already answered, I can just point them to the Wiki page.</li>
</ol>
<p>I find a lot of people waste too much time on formatting in a Wiki environment and not enough time on just taking the notes.  For this reason, I've found Wikit (<a href="http://www.equi4.com/starkit/wikit.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.equi4.com/starkit/wikit.html</a>) to be the best Wiki software.  It's easy to setup and run (has a built in webserver), and has enough formatting options to keep me satisfied, but not so many that I get overwhelmed.</p>

<p>It's a great tool that use for keep scratch notes, my daily journal entries in date format. I keep the sources for connecting to my blog, which is nice to have an offline archive. I keep general programming notes and code snippets in a Loose Leaf format organized by language. I keep a Bug/Error Listing for those <strong>@#($&amp;@#(*$</strong> they didn't document THAT moments and the appropriate workarounds. There are customizable templates you can create to save time on repetitious entries. For me these are the built in headers and bullets for my revision notes, daily time logs and workout notes.</p>
<p>Generally I keep my other writing projects, including my novel in here too. The program is very flexible and just plain works well for how I function. I also love how I can install it on my USB Jump Drive, just like my PIM/Business mail program and keep it with me regardless of what computers/machines I am using.</p>
<p>To those whom have mentioned mindmaps, I use those for brainstorming primarily, but that for me needs to be a paper/whiteboard exercise. There is something about the process of creating mindmaps for me that needs to remain somewhat organic. Generally after I complete a map I will either post it on my cork board or scan it/draw it to include in whatever the map was made for. There are a few good programs out there for creating them, particularly <a href="http://www.mindjet.com/" rel="nofollow" title="MindJet MindManager Pro">

                <p>Well I'm using XEmacs nearly all day long,  so it's "natural" to use it for everything. The mode to keep on snippets, notices etc is named planner. Which is a wiki like stuff. The stuff is simply kept in text  files and that's the unbeatable....</p>

<ul>
<li>Tomboy for small and quick notes.</li>
<li>A physical notebook, for bigger projects which need better planning and lots of sketching.</li>
<li>A white board to draw diagrams, and after i'm done i take a picture of it to archive it.</li>

                <p>I have used TadaLists with relative success - good for sharing with others for cross-person lists. I typically keep only certain types of lists (i.e. application ideas, technical checklists for an eclipse install, remaining items for small apps, etc.). I have found some bugs with the re-ordering, but other than that, it's really simple and quick. Certainly there are better tools out there targeted at developers, but this works for me (for now). One major benefit is that it follows me - I can't misplace it or forget it at home, and can access anywhere I have Internet, which whenever I need it, is practically always there.</p>
<p>Previously, I've used notebooks with limited success (lose them), and the whiteboard on my desk (out of date too quickly).</p>

                <p>I use <strong>Daisy WIKI / CMS</strong> (<a href="http://cocoondev.org/daisy/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://cocoondev.org/daisy/index.html</a>) to keep my developer notes.  The reasons are rather simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rather <strong>free-formed note-keeping</strong>, but with easy structure if I desire H1/H2/H3, etc.</li>
<li>Easily Searched Content (<strong>full-text search</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>Attachments</strong> can be kept well-organized with my notes - whether attached PDFs, Images (which are visible inline), Word documents, etc.</li>
<li>Easy inclusion of <strong>Hyperlinks</strong> to intra-WIKI AND external references - I use this to keep notes about related web sites close at hand, as well as links to local documents/files on my internal FTP server.  Saves a TON of time when I need to find things.</li>
<li>Now the BIG ONE: <strong>BOOK PRINTING</strong>!  It is so wonderful how Daisy has an integrated PDF/HTML book-rendering engine.  You can define navigation-trees that tell what WIKI page(s) go into your book, and they will be combined into nice chapter/heading/subheading hierarchical trees in the TOC as well as having automatic-footnotes generated for things like the hyperlinks and other non-embeddable (in printed-book) things like referenced Word docs and such.  Images print in books just fine.</li>
<li>Another BIG FEATURE: <strong>MULTIPLE "VIEWS" of my WIKI pages/notes</strong>.  I can use those hierarchical navigation-tree definitions to re-use my notes in multiple ways.  E.g., I define an "internal notes" book that includes all my documentation (including developer-notes), and another "external notes" book that includes only things my end-users would want to see.  These views can apply to not just books, but also how people access the WIKI itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>That is why I use Daisy, in a nutshell.  As you can tell, I rather like it! :)</p>

                <p>I use Emacs, along with planner mode and remember mode.  Planner mode is a TODO list software, with PIM features, and it sits on top of Muse-mode, which is basically wiki software for emacs.</p>
<p>At the core of planner is the daily page.  IT is a new wiki page that is created every day.  I keep my daily journal in these daily pages.  it also stores daily appointments, and tasks.</p>
<p>If I am starting up a new project, I will create a new wiki page for it.  At this point, I can start adding tasks right away with planner mode, and linking them to daily pages (for their due dates).  Additionally, you can create wikilinks to other projects (for super-projects or sub-projects.)  or even links to files and file positions in the filesystem. </p>
<p>So notes regarding a particular project would go into that projects page.  Checklists would become todo items.  Final solutions would also belong in there.  Code snippets exist as links to that particular file, plus some notes to go along with it.</p>
<p>Everything is in one nice and central place in my IDE.  It's bliss for me.</p>

<sup style="font-size:9px">[2]</sup>.</li>
<li>Every user story and its development history is formalized and documented into an "issue" created using <a href="http://ifdefined.com/bugtrackernet.html" rel="nofollow">

<sup style="font-size:9px">[3]</sup>, and is developed/versioned using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subversion_(software)" rel="nofollow">

</a>
<sup style="font-size:9px">[5]</sup>.</li>
<li>When i commit come changes, I attach some notes into the revision that describes the actions taken and the strategies adoped.</li>
<li>My project's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subversion_(software)" rel="nofollow">

<sup style="font-size:9px">[7]</sup> instance, so every time i commit something, into the user story is added a relationship to the changed files and their notes.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>In this way, every note I take is related to a specific development workflow and is avaiable for further analisys.

                <p>Over the years I have tried so many tools myself, I don't even know remember what I tried. I know that Google Notebook was among them, wikis (serveral) as well, <a href="http://basecamphq.com/" rel="nofollow">

<p>One important thing that I learned in the process was, that whatever tool I use, failure always came when I started slacking off. For example, I did not stick to my plan [using X] and that is what created F'ups down the road. It didn't really matter what I used, be it a wiki, or a moleskine or something else.</p>
<p>I am currently using the todo-list feature on my e71. And I have for the past year or so always used my phones capabilities to keep track of my tasks. I enter pretty much everything in there and set a due date etc.. This has helped me a lot. I syncronize my phone with an online calendar which I also update with whatever I have to do. This is as far as personal organization.</p>
<p>For keeping records on stuff I build and solutions to common problems, I currently employ my own <a href="http://pbwiki.com/" rel="nofollow">
PBWiki
</a>
<sup style="font-size:9px">[3]</sup> account.</p>
<p>What I generally like about the wiki approach is that the structure is very flexible. I can enter information, and re-organize it later on. It also allows me to restructure information when I think I need to. I usually organize my entered data weekly.</p>
<p>The only downside to a wiki is that you need Internet, and that you need to be dedicated about entering information later when there is no Internet currently. It's something I constantly struggle with. ;) The phone and wifi really help, but in the end it's up to me.</p>

                <p>These days I use plain text files (I'll leave the vi vs. emacs debates for others).  I have a dropbox account so the files get synched to each of my machines automagicly.

                <p>i made a ratty little program i call InfoCache.  it's written in delphi and uses the MS Access engine.  it also uses the (somewhat frail) access replication.  it presently has about 8000 entries in it.  pretty cool.  it's searchable &amp; can contain UU Encoded binary files as well.</p>

Yojimbo
</a>
<sup style="font-size:9px">[1]</sup>. It works well for keeping not just text but images, PDF documents, web sites (links and full archives), etc.</p>
<p>I have collections for common things that are not tied to any single project (syntax cheat sheets, interface guidelines, etc.).  I create a separate collection for each specific project where I put things like web research, code snippets, requirements docs, and engineering notes. Yojimbo allows the same item to be in more than one collection so it's easy to aggregate project-specific and general-but-related information in one place.</p>
<p>Yojimbo syncs all its information (via MobileMe) to all of my machines so I have the data wherever I am. But unlike web-only solutions the information is actually stored locally on each machine. That means I can work offline (I usually commute by train) and everything syncs up the next time I connect.</p>

                <p>During the thinking process a sheet of paper is great for me - I can sketck, draw, mark, put number while debugging, etc. This is for temporary memos, however. For more general and long-term information I use docs and/or spreadsheets, depending on the information itself.</p>
<p>For most important, mid-duration memos I like to use source files and simple text files - todos, marks for needing optimization / further reviewing - all fit very well among the code, since this keeps them well up to date. </p>
<p>Also sometimes when I am really into something and I have to interrupt - I put a small summary, in the current source file, of what the current state is and what are immediate steps that must be taken to continue - this helps me to restart very fast when back.</p>

                <p>I use a notebook. I am a visual guy so I like to draw diagrams of workflows, mockups, schemas and so on, so computer based tools are too clumsy compared to a pen and paper and sitting back on the sofa. A tablet PC is not an adequate replacement either. You can't beat the feel of paper, the high DPI, the instance feedback, etc.</p>
<p>I also have a personal SVN repository of project code and snippets.</p>
<p>I would also set up a personal Wiki for when I am having to write or document things, often snippet-based best practice notes.</p>
<p>I use a ToDo list manager application for listing tasks I need to do. The one in Outlook is not suitable in any manner, you need one that can handle task hierarchies - an outliner basically. OmniOutliner on the Mac is great, and OmniGraffle is great for drawing up those notebook scribbles later on.</p>
<p>There are applications that can be used for authors when writing books, and I think there is room for a tool that does the same for programmers.</p>

                <p>I like to use one of those bright yellow note pads. I have always preferred to write my notes/ideas out by hand rather than use a word processing or note taking software. It feels like I am able to explore ideas easier on a note pad because I can make quick sketches of ideas, connect two separate thoughts using arrows, or just doodle.</p>
<p>I think the notepad gives me the ability to have a uninterrupted stream of thought. If I am typing I easily get distracted by an IM message, go to a website, or what ever. I seem to be more distracted when I try to write notes or ideas using the computer.</p>
<p>Maybe I am old fashioned. I don't know.</p>

                <p>I have currently begun using sharepoint. More because VS Team Foundation automatically creates a sharepoint site for each project created. This, so far has been an excellent place to put documents about the project (Design docs, 3rd party utility docs etc) as well as forum like dicussion boards etc.</p>
<p>Now, that being said, that is project / team based. We also have a division level sharepoint site where we do much the same. </p>

<p>I miss InfoDepot (an old Classic Mac application) for this sort of thing. In fact, I'd still use it (I have several copies; former employee of the company which made it -- before my programming days, mind you) except that printing from an emulator is nigh-impossible.

<p>Would that there was a Windows app similar to OmniOutliner/InfoDepot -- that's the ideal note-taking/organization app for me. I've often toyed with the idea of making one ... </p>

                <p>As indicated by the amount of replies here, there are many options. Which you choose depends on your requirements, which might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>fast text entry</li>
<li>versioning</li>
<li>organizing notes</li>
<li>drawing images / graphs</li>
<li>searching through notes</li>
<li>archiving of your notes</li>
<li>distribution / accessibility</li>
</ul>
<p>The main advantages that paper have over any digital options are in drawing images, as well as fast text entry -- it is often much easier to reach for a notebook than to find a program on the computer, if only because usually, my desk is a lot bigger than my monitor, and is used ony to store paper things (and coffee mugs, off course).</p>
<p>In the digital realm, simple text files with a versioning tool (subversion or darcs) seem to satisfy all the requirements very well, so that is what I use whenever I just want to jot down text (I type a lot faster than I can write). Fast text entry is my most important issue though -- I type a lot more notes than I ever re-read. An absolute requirement for me is therefore that I can just summon an empty note with a single keystroke from any context.</p>

                <p>Personally, I use Notepad++ for long term notes and Notepad for short term cut and paste items. Everything else we keep in our CM system (i.e. design details/notes, requirements, source code).

                <p>I've found that using a wiki is a great way of doing things, but if you can get everyone in the same room, there's nothing better than an active tape recorder, a big whiteboard, and a camera for capturing the state of the whiteboard as you work together. Even if you're working solo, the whiteboard and camera can be very useful as a way of tracking how your mind flows while working on a project.</p>
<p>Also useful, of course, is the tree of text files, especially when kept in a source repository (for the always helpful revisioning that occurs), but a wiki is just as good, if not better for this.</p>

                <p>I just use a text editor and store all my snippets in a set of folders organised by language. I put the code with a brief description in the file of what it's for and then title the document with what it's an example of and use that title to name the file. Once this is done, you have a question and an answer that can be searched (Google Desktop?) or browsed through the file system to get at an answer of how to do something. I try to apply a bit of a "refactoring" methodology, by only writing something up if I'm using it for the third time. That way, I don't have to scrabble for an answer again and I know the code is likely to be reused again, so it's worth my time to document it.</p>
<p>A highly ranked answer by JBB mentioned note books. I agree with that person, something in my brain clicks in to action when I write something down, which is not happening when I type in to a computer. It some how solidifies the information in my brain. There is one draw back to notebooks. Search, retrieval and sharing of information aren't so easy, which I guess is why stackoverflow.com and other sites are about.</p>

                <p>I use emacs org-mode together with remember. Under org-mode I use a GTD file with topics and tasks and a task-topic to gather tasks yet to be distributed over topics (or projects). Remember allows one to quickly add new tasks (they go into the task-topic at the top of the file) and notes (they go into a notes file, but can carry a reference to a topic (project).</p>
<p>The GTD file, the notes file and an archive of completed tasks are all kept under Git version control. At work, at the end of the day I push these files to Github. At home I can pull them out of Github; add stuff, commit the files and push them to Github.</p>
<p>Simple text files organize notes and projects and can be reached from anywhere.</p>

                <p>I have a couple of text files...  One for my one-liners &amp; PERL inside vim.  One for sysadmin help when I did that job, how to "config a scsi tape drive" use the "dd" command to format a floppy, etc.  And I have a good sized directory that includes everything from one use shell scripts, to perl stuff cut-n-hacked out of the man page examples saved off as things like PERL_Function_Test.pl, all the way up to some of my medium sized data cruncher and stat generator programs.
This way, I can grep stuff out of them as needed.  And I'm a little on the lazy side, I have aliases that grep stuff out of my help files.  And if anyone asks me a question I don't have time to answer, I tell them to look at my alias "gp" which does "grep *! ~/hints/perl_one_liners.txt"</p>

                <p>I use a method very similar to JBB's, only I use small three ring binders instead of notebooks, because this way I can better organize the pages, and use all kinds of paper (blank for sketches, ruled for normal writing, etc.)</p>
<p>I also have an adjustable hole puncher so I can put anything in there (printings, magazine clippings).</p>
<p>Fortunately, the size of the binder pages is half letter size, so I can print anything without having to load special paper into the printer, and I just cut it afterwards.</p>
<p>I tried blogs, wikis, and all sorts of more advanced tools, but none has worked better than this one. Although I'm thinking of improving it by scanning the pages and uploading them to a blog or some other web tool so I can look at them anytime.</p>

You are right that the single file things bloat and I did fail to mention that I do not use a single Wiki on a Stick for all things. I've got an intro html page that leads into multiple Wiki on a Stick instance. The intro page is a <em>gasp</em> frameset so that I've always got navigation to at least the top levels of my other sites. I have one wiki for gaming notes, one wiki for development reference, one wiki for recipes, one wiki for my blogging/writing notes, etc. (My work wiki is organized similarly by client and/or project.) I find this a minimal amount of work for staying away from specific file formats and staying with open html/javascript.</p>

                <p>This is a great thread and I will certainly be checking out some of these alternatives.</p>
<p>The solution I was using was to find a notetaker that consolidates to just one flat file and then use something like FolderShare or DropBox to sync it with my home, office, and laptop PCs.</p>
<p>The downside to this is that many of these single file things (like TiddlyWiki) don't scale very well over time.  After 2 years, TiddlyWiki became so bloated and slow that I gave up the notetaking concept all together.</p>
<p>Now I actually use <em>gasp</em> Outlook tasks. </p>

<p>My rationale is that what I wrote to solve one problem only solves that particular case and probably just barely does so.  Think about it.  If you're writing code it means that you either A) didn't look for an existing solution in the operating environment you're running under, or B) the need isn't general enough to warrant inclusion in the library.  In either case, what makes you think your code is the answer to this class of problem every time you encounter it.  Odds are, it's not.  Your solution isn't as reusable as you think.</p>
<p>Besides, how could you ever justify jumping to a new language if requires you to leave your comfort zone? ;)</p>

                <p>I've been using Google Docs for notes so I can have them available on all my machines. Paradoxically though I'm finding that as Google adds more word processor features Docs becomes less useful for me as a note-taking app. For example, there are now red squiggles for misspellings that I can't seem to turn off. I'm thinking about switching to Word or some other file-based solution and syncing with Live Mesh.</p>

                <p>Depends on the scope of the note, I suppose.  For to-do list type things, I use FogBugz. (It's free for small teams and students)</p>
<p>For random notes, my old usage pattern was to open up a copy of NotePad, type stuff, then lose it because I restart my computer without saving it somewhere.  Addressing my issue, I created a note program for my own personal use.  Think of it as notepad with tabs and autosave, or alternatively, think of it like OneNote but not bloated.

                <p>I've used a number of methods over the years:</p>
<p><strong>Paper Notebooks</strong></p>
<p>Like most people, I started out keeping notes in a spiral bound notebook. This method has one big, fairly obvious advantage: you can draw what ever you want - text, diagrams pictures, whatever. Notebooks last a long time with proper care. The drawbacks are inability to search and the fact that I have atrocious handwriting. And killing trees, I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>MS OneNote</strong></p>
<p>I have access to this at work and it's one MS product I really like. It has individual files for notebooks. This is great for organizing things at the project level. I can use a notebook for a project and then remove it form OneNote when the project is over. I still have it if I need it, but it's not in the way. It integrates tightly with Outlook - you can create meeting notes for an Outlook event with a single click and create tasks &amp; link them to items in OneNote. It also supports diagrams and highlighting. The main drawback is that it's Windows only and it's not cheap.</p>
<p><strong>Omni Outliner (Mac)</strong></p>
<p>It's a very nice outlining tool and I still use it for lists and things (often in conjunction w/ Curio, below). But it falls short in organizing, traversing and searching large amounts of data. It just seems a bit cumbersome for all that.</p>
<p><strong>Curio (Mac)</strong></p>
<p>My current method of choice. I've tried Evernote, but (unlike a previous author) I can't get past the non hierarchical organization. Curio allows me to have a separate notebook (file) for each project, create simple diagrams, links and other do-dads. You can also create &amp; embed documents on a page. The drawback is that, like OneNote, it's not cheap.  </p>

                <p>I always dedicate one of my desktops to a fullscreen emacs, so writing notes is only an Alt-Tab away. I store my notes in files called 'notes' in the relevant directory. The notes tend to get monolithic, but are quite useful because I either never read them at all, or I read through the whole thought process again and again.</p>

                <p>I've read through the massive list of comments and there are a lot of good ideas in there.  Personally, I've been using more and more of google's tools, such as google notes and google documents.  Most of the coding I do is internal and requires me to vpn to work to get at.  This can be inaccessible in some situations, I love the way I can always access my stuff on google, which is better than say a desktop application where the documents would be only on a local pc somewhere, or on the company wiki (which requires vpn access), or in source control (same as the wiki).  Google tools have really good and quick searching technology built in.  Until I find a really good global solution, I'm going to continue using Google. </p>

                <p>I wish StackOverflow was up-and-running a few months ago when I scoured the web for the answer to this exact question.  I had used Microsoft OneNote at a previous company, but no longer had access to it where I now work.  I tried using some of the Wiki-based applications, but quickly got frustrated with it's usage model.  I had also looked at some of the mind-mapping products out there, but those didn't fit the bill for me either.  I have since settled on EverNote and have been using it for several weeks now.</p>
<p>I had my doubts at first because of its lack of support for organizing notes in a hierarchical fashion, but I've gotten over that.  I like the fact that it supports tags and that you can filter your view by multi-selecting various tags.</p>
<p>I also like the fact that it runs locally, but can be synchronized on the Web.  I had looked into the Google Notebook application, but didn't like the web-only UI.</p>

<p>A couple people I've worked with have just used Notepad to type notes in and they save a single text file for each day of work. Then they can use something like Google Desktop Search to search through all their notes.</p>

                <p>I could write a ton on what I do and why!</p>
<p>Basically, I use standard 3 ring notebooks, with squared paper.</p>
<p>I do this, because I find it is the most flexible method.
It is easy to merge existing documentation and my own thoughts.
It is easy to re-organize.
The use of squared paper allows me to do diagrams and tables either in portrait or in landscape mode.</p>
<p>For small projects, I use a single notebook to hold several projects.
For larger projects, I use one to several notebooks.</p>
<p>Random notes are simply kept in a notes section, and reorganized, as the organization becomes obvious.</p>
<p>All notes are dated.</p>
<p>When I convert notes to documents, I use Wordpad for the first draft, because of it's simple word processing capability.
(The more complexity you have, the more time you waste on the prettyness.)</p>
<p>I try to keep one small topic per page to simplify reprinting.</p>
<p>Eventualy, documents become formalized, and are converted to Word or PDF files.
(When this happens, it is no longer my problem.)</p>
<p>This method stood me well in my career as a programmer and analyst.
In fact it got me a years worth of consulting.
I got a contract to document the large system I helped to develope.
I was the ONLY programmer (of 20) on the project who had bothered to do any documentation at all.</p>
<p>I was able to justify doing documentation (to others), as it kept me sane while doing on-call support and trouble-shooting for the whole system.</p>
<p>The method I used for this was an enhancement to the above notes system, with considerations for the incremental nature of the notes for a whole system.</p>
<p>Perhaps someone will ask a question about this topic.</p>

                <p>I used to really like legal pads.  I never missed anything, and everyone was quite happy.  There's nothing like waving a legal pad around with pages of crossed-out tasks when the more Dilbert-themed managers wander by for showing progress.</p>
<p>That is, of course, until after a couple years the legal pads had accumulated several pages or so of low-importance, high-tediousness tasks.</p>
<p>Obviously, those types of tasks should have expired and disappeared, but I continued to copy them over and over again.  I'm not sure what drove me to do so.  OCD?</p>
<p>I probably should be all "Yo yo yo...  I gots myself a tasks wiki integrated with VS2008 Team Server, and as I enter or complete items my current location is all imported-like from my iPhone and marked up on my Google Earth super-mashup along with the GPS locations of everyone I've done talked to about it...  Later, I'll do a GE flyby on my completed tasks...  way cool"</p>
<p>Nah.  For years now it's all Notepad, KEdit, and post-its.</p>
<p>KISS.</p>
<p>Of course, I can't read post-its on my monitor from a client's site... so I may be due for a re-think.  Webcams, maybe?  :)</p>

                <p>I have a "personal productivity" wiki with Wetpaint.</p>
<p>I've used standard written notebooks in the past, but they have the same recurring problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Half of my notes are junk or temporary. So I need to keep re-writing the good ones.</li>
<li>My notes become unsearchable.  If you start going through 1-2 notebooks / year, how do I find the "<em>last time I spoke with Client X</em>" or the "<em>date I changed code Y</em>". You end up carrying around 2 notebooks at once.</li>
<li>My notes lack hyperlinking, file storage and images. In other words, the paper notes simply couldn't mimic the mental mappings that I had created.</li>
</ol>
<p>My new strategy has three parts, but one focus: <strong>good data should be digitized in flexible "wiki-style format"</strong>. This happens in three parts:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Scrap paper</strong> / <strong>Whiteboard</strong>: for "active work items". Contains things like DB IDs, mock-ups and other temporary items.</li>
<li><strong>Portable notebook</strong>: for random thoughts or things I need to write down before moving them to the wiki (say I don't have 'Net access). Really more of a creative drop-point than a working book.</li>
<li><strong>The Wiki</strong>: everything important should end up in here. I keep a daily "what I did" list and then archive off the weeks and months. This makes my personal activity history searchable. I keep an active "Wish List" so that I don't forget client requests. Having a wiki also means that I can upload files, add hyperlinks and actually organize my data (good old copy-paste).</li>
</ol>
<p>Some people have mentioned <strong>blogs</strong> and I think that this is a reasonable starting ground for sharing. But blogs are a weak way to organize evolving data. Things change and wikis are simply the natural home for things that change.</p>

                <p>It's gonna sound stupid but a couple of years back I actually backed down a lot on notes trying to keep things in my head instead. If you take it step by step you'll learn to keep more and more stuff in there at the same time. I didn't bother to learn some kind of technique but I guess you should do what you feel fits best. </p>
<p>I do keep track of schedules, bugs and features in a plain text file but that is mostly to have something to cross out when I'm done. I've noticed how much faster I work and how my designs get better the more stuff I keep in my head -highly recommended!</p>

                <p>If you take notes and you can't find them later, then they are useless.</p>
<p>I've had good results from gmail for notes that I don't want to make public and a public blog for things that should be public.  In gmail, I have a label called "notes" and inside notes emails I include an abstract and a list of keywords that describe the information.  This makes the information very searchable and it is easy to update overtime either by saving an open item as a draft or replying to an item with a new email.

                <p>At work I have an Oxford Composition notebook that I use for meetings.  I use Notepad to keep track of things I'm working on, on a daily basis, and these are all stored in one folder, named by date, and indexed with Windows Search 4.0.  I also have a whiteboard next to my desk, and I take pictures of it with my iPhone and upload them to Evernote, which translates the text and makes all my whiteboard images searchable.  Not very organized yet.</p>

<sup style="font-size:9px">[1]</sup> and regular good old pen and paper. The tagging capabilities and the possibility to share,and access the notes from everywhere are valuable. I also use the google web history to find reference links I didn't note or tag in the notebook.</p>

<p>The thing is, <em>you need</em> a google account. And there are the privacy and confidientiality issues. </p>
<p>Pen (or pencil) and paper still rule when it comes to brainstorming and conceiving. One drawback with my system is that the pen and paper entries must be reported back to the online notebook. I find it tedious sometimes, but it forces me to review and reorganize my thoughts and my todo lists.</p>

                <p>For noting and discussing new details, and also for bug fixing, I have found Mantis being an very nice tool, and, using Eurekalog as a bug reporter, it can store the bugs directly in the system, from anywhere. (But I haven't taking this in use still, since my Mantis is mainly to be used with my php-based programs, while my Delphi-things are for other companies, so I have to find a commercial mantis site (I have probably found one, which also support blogs and also commercial components to)</p>
<p>Otherwise I use an old-fashioned flip-over instead of a blackboard for discussing architectual things. When changing to another project, just flip over the paper and continue on a new paper. When going back to the other project, just flip back again :-)</p>
<p>And for formally describing flowcharts etc. to be sent as files to others, I have started to use Microsoft Visio, but, I find documentation on how to use it rather scarce :-(</p>

                <p>I don't use a specific tool to keep notes, but rather prefer to make any remarks in the comments at or near the actual code. Whenever I need something later on, I generally remember where I used it first or I'll just search my code library for it. Even when I just think of something for later use, not as part of a current project, I'll just throw together something that demonstrates the idea and save that for later use.</p>
<p>I find that my source library is the first place I look for old ideas anyway and that's why I started using it this way. An added advantage is that I also have a lot of other people's code sitting in there and sometimes when I look for my own notes, I find the answer in other people's comments and solutions.</p>

                <p>I have been enjoying OneNote lately, esp since I added a pen tablet to the desk. 
Being able to add quick little drawings makes it almost as cool as pencil and paper.<br />
Bonus being that I dont end up with as much dead tree to sort through at the end of the week/month.<br />
The integration with outlook tasks list also very handy.</p>

                <p>VIM 7 with UTL plugin is awesome. Just type text any way you like and with a simple shortcut macro you can press a key (F5 for me) and it will open a http link, a PDF file, etc. Since this is VIM, that means you can also use this to jump from one file to another and thus have pretty much a Wiki if you like. It can be as simple or as advanced as you like.</p>

<sup style="font-size:9px">[2]</sup>). It helps that you could link the notes directly to your repository source code, tag your entries, use ticketing system and so forth. It's a great and indisposable tool for collaborative development.
If you are a lone wolf anything would do but something with good searching capabilities would definitely be more useful. I would suggest MS OneNote because of Live Search integration but that's just my personal preference.</p>

                <p>Opening a blog has the many bonuses:</p>
<ol>
<li>the comments from the other friends developers may help you a great deal</li>
<li>you are going to polish everything (sooner or later) because you know that stuff is public</li>
<li>it may give you more visibility than a resume</li>
<li>can be accessed virtually from anywhere (as many note-taking webapps)</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course some stuff is not suitable for the masses. In this case I suggest some text files, an USB key and a good editor (Ultraedit, Notepad++). A naming convention and an automatic file catalog may come in handy when the number of files grows.</p>

                <p>I'm going to have to give another nod to Evernote. For now, it is the solution I use. Just a few reasons I find it useful as a developer:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to create synchronized as well as local notebooks (to satisfy security concerns)</li>
<li>The builtin screenshot snipper tool is top notch, and it works well with a tablet. Hit print screen, jot some notes, and it's in your notebook.</li>
<li>Search is good. Can even search text within screenshots!</li>
<li>It can index and seach handwritten notes (uses MS Ink technology, I believe)</li>
<li>I can get to it from my Android phone easily</li>
<li>The tagging system is effective</li>
<li>It's convenient and can be called to duty with a simple hotkey combo</li>
</ul>
<p>I have tried a few other tools, and a few GTD apps. This is the one I'm using for now, until something better rears it's head.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

                <p>I use MS OneNote 2007 and achieve the following:
1)collaborative authoring: including restrictions passwords, collaborate via SharePoint or a SharedFolder on my local disk. I dont need to worry about others needing to know any markup text, very straightforward - just like typing in Word- support for tables, colored text etc!
2) real time chat/discussion (sharing session!)
3) whiteboard/drawing 
4)search text from pasted images/ great search across notebooks
5) ability to flag items 
6)Good integration with MSOutlook: I can send emails/Meeting Items and Contacts directly to OneNOte, (an annotate/add special notes to the content
7) Create PDFs or email One Note pages to people 
8) I can send PDF/PPT to one Note: allows further annotation
9) When I view Web content, I can send an entire page or just one line of text directly to OneNote and one note even saves the link for me!
10) I can also have record audio and if i provide keywords during the recording, the play back will begin from the point from where I made the annotated keywords
11) I can even search based on changes made by others or me to the notebook
12) I also use OneNote during meetings: jot down minutes, flag to do items: I create custom flags or use the out of the box tag that read Critical/ TO do...and later I can create a summary of all flagged items across notebooks. 
13) I sync OneNOte with my office copy and home copy
14) and When I buy my Windows Mobile I can use the Active Sync Feature of OneNote...!!
15) I also write out my thinkings in OneNOte and send them to Word and take it from there for a professional doc that needs to go out to people.
16) Screen grabs are also reallyyy neat! 
17) I also embed files (audio- mp3 of a meeting, a Word doc that I may need to view later etc)
18) I also love the fact that I do not need to keep saving as i type! It autosaves!
19) I used oneNote even as a calculator: if I type 1+ 2= on a OneNote page, and press Enter I get an answer typed out for me!
Maybe I will come back and add more later..but I can go on about using OneNote 2007 and how useful it is!</p>

<li>One to keep track of what needs to be done, I also use this to manage my personal and professional projects.</li>

<p>Then I process things with google calendar and backpack. My google calendar is used to setup extensive reminders, and all the calendars are linked into backpack. I even display project specific calendars on each "page" relative to that project in backpack.</p>
<p>For things that I just need reminders for, I add that to backpack as well. All of these reminders are SMS'd to my phone.</p>

                <p>My blog, combined with Evernote.</p>
<p>Notes go in Evernote, and can be screenshots, whiteboard photo's, hand written and scanned notes, typed notes and URLs, and code snippets. I can easily tag all this stuff and organize it.</p>
<p>When stuff is non-NDA and public knowledge, I move the notes to my public notebook for everybody to see. If I have the time and I have found something interesting, I post it on my blog.</p>
<p>My blog only contains answers. No questions. It servers as an external memory which I also use to refer to when people ask me questions. It saves me and them a lot of time and makes people happy.</p>
<p>You can get Evernote here: <a href="http://www.evernote.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.evernote.com/</a></p>

                <p>i use treepad. i create a tree that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>- 2009
-- 01
--- 2009-01-01
---- client/project 2009-01-01 a description of what was done
---- client/project 2009-01-01 a description of the 2nd thing
--- 2009-01-02
and so on
</code></pre>
<p>i don't think it matters much if you use a wiki or treepad or whatever as long as its searchable. i like to keep things organized by day. at the "day level" of the tree i record and overview of what i did. in the children of that node, i put the details (sql queries, sometimes code snippets, etc). the big thing imo is to make sure it is searchable. treepad has a relatively fast search capability that lets me find when i did what and for whom i did it.</p>
<p>i started doing things this way in 2005. before that i kept a paper diary of sorts. before that (pre 2000) i didn't keep track of anything. i have to say that starting my daily treepad diary is the single most productive thing that i've ever done. i use it religiously and the rewards have been many.</p>

                <p>I've recently been using the Pulse Smartpen, which is an ink pen on paper solution that also happens to have an infrared camera builtin with audio recording and 2 gig storage: <a href="http://www.livescribe.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.livescribe.com/</a>. I use this for capturing design ideas and drawings, meeting notes, and pretty much anything I normally write down. It records all your writings and drawings and links them to the audio recordings -- really has to be seen to fully appreciate. The notebooks get synced from your pen to your computer, and can also be uploaded to free cloudspace on their website where your notebooks or sessions can optionally be shared. There is no built in OCR, but there is an optional add-on that integrates with it. And it has built-in text search on your written documents (which must be using some OCR behind the scenes).</p>

<p>Thumbtack is an easy way to save links, photos, and anything else you can find on bunch of different Web sites to a single place.  Grab the stuff you want, put it into a Thumbtack collection, then get to it from anywhere you can get online.  Share it with your friends, or just keep it for yourself. It’s way easier than sending a bunch of links in an e-mail, and even easier than setting lots of favorites in your browser. </p>

                <p>Some excellent notes here already...</p>
<p>Evernote is great because it bridges the analog/digital gap, in a way Google Notebook couldn't. Now that Notebook is leaving google, Ever note will begin to look more impressive. Think of Evernote as a personal butler, that will take scribbles, cameraphone screenshots of basic plans and tie them all together. It still needs effort in tying work to each project you are working on however.</p>
<p>The feel of doing on paper work for creative work cannot be lost neither - scribbling basic web layouts is still (for me) faster on a page, done as crudely as the timeline gives me. Having this is something I can refine latter on if needed - and Evernote will let me scribble on it while retaining the original copy.</p>

                <p>I use Microsoft OneNote.</p>
<p>When I start talking to someone about a project I start an outline in OneNote. It could start very simple like the results of a first phone call to setup an appointment without much more than a project name and some very basic information.</p>
<p>As I ask questions, talk to other people and do my own investigation I add to and with OneNote can easily modify the outline very quickly. </p>
<p>If possible I'll put the outline up on a screen and develop the design and requirements in collaboration and in real time with the people who know and care about the project.</p>
<p>In all cases I will email, show or print the outline to the stakeholders to see if this is a good representation of what they want.</p>
<p>My next step is to refine the outline now taking into account to how the data will be organized, what type of program (web, windows forms, windows service, etc.) and continue the design so that I have a clear path to start on actual database and software implementation.</p>
<p>As I go along in the project I can further refine particularly complicated parts and be left with some good design documentation.</p>
<p>For a new or prospective client, during the first interview I can capture what they say and provide some detailed feedback via email after the meeting which usually has a very positive effect!</p>
