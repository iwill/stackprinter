          <div id="question">
          <p>When I teach introductory computer science courses, I like to lighten the mood with some humor. Having a sense of fun about the material makes it less frustrating and more memorable, and it's even motivating if the joke requires some technical understanding to 'get it'!</p>
<p>I'll start off with a couple of my favorites:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How do you tell an introverted computer scientist from an extroverted computer scientist?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> An extroverted computer scientist looks at <em>your</em> shoes when he talks to you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the classic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why do programmers always mix up Halloween and Christmas?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Because Oct 31 == Dec 25!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm always looking for more of these, and I can't think of a better group of people to ask. What are your best programmer/computer science/programming jokes?</p>

                    Subjective is a reason for closing?  Does that mean that every question with a &quot;Subjective&quot; tag is going to be closed now?

I asked why she didn&#39;t think of that, and she responded with, &quot;I&#39;m in software, That&#39;s a hardware problem&quot;.

                <p>A young Programmer and his Project Manager board a train headed through
the mountains on its way to Wichita. They can find no place to sit
except for two seats right across the aisle from a young woman and her
grandmother. After a while, it is obvious that the young woman and the
young programmer are interested in each other, because they are giving each other looks. Soon the train passes into a tunnel and it is pitch black. There is a sound of a kiss followed by the sound of a slap.</p>
<p>When the train emerges from the tunnel, the four sit there without saying a word. The grandmother is thinking to herself, “It was very brash for that young man to kiss my granddaughter, but I’m glad she slapped him.”</p>
<p>The Project manager is sitting there thinking, “I didn’t know the young tech was brave enough to kiss the girl, but I sure wish she hadn’t missed him when she slapped me!”</p>
<p>The young woman was sitting and thinking, “I’m glad the guy kissed me, but I wish my grandmother had not slapped him!”</p>
<p>The young programmer sat there with a satisfied smile on his face. He thought to himself, “Life is good. How often does a guy have the chance to kiss a beautiful girl and slap his Project manager all at the same time!”</p>

              The joke can be refactored by placing the two men opposite each other with the girl next to the programmer, and eliminating the grandmother and the actual kiss, as follows:

Emerging from the tunnel, the manager is holding his cheek in pain. The girl thinks &quot;The guy tried to kiss me, but accidentally kissed this guy next to me, who slapped him.&quot; The manager thinks &quot;That geek kissed her, but she thought it was me and slapped me.&quot; And the programmer thinks &quot;Can&#39;t wait till the next tunnel so I can kiss the back of my hand and slap him again!&quot; - <b> Paul Richter</b>

                <p>A physicist, an engineer and a programmer were in a car driving over a steep alpine pass when the brakes failed. The car was getting faster and faster, they were struggling to get round the corners and once or twice only the feeble crash barrier saved them from crashing down the side of the mountain. They were sure they were all going to die, when suddenly they spotted an escape lane. They pulled into the escape lane, and came safely to a halt.</p>
<p>The physicist said "We need to model the friction in the brake pads and the resultant temperature rise, see if we can work out why they failed".</p>
<p>The engineer said "I think I've got a few spanners in the back. I'll take a look and see if I can work out what's wrong".</p>
<p>The programmer said "Why don't we get going again and see if it's reproducible?"</p>

              It&#39;s talking about playing games, in which you are usually given a task (kill X) and then do it and the task can&#39;t change. Not developing games which is probably one of the hardest programming fields out there. - <b> p5ycho_p3nguin</b>

              Unfortunately, some games have reached the point where they mimic life ... so while you are off saving the siren from the fire-breathing monster, your quest fails because you forgot to use the correct sword, even though it wasn&#39;t mentioned in the specs. - <b> Dave DuPlantis</b>

                <p>In the 1960's the KGB was very interested in learning everything possible about the American space program, sending all sorts of spies to find every possible piece of information.</p>
<p>One afternoon, a breathless spy returned to headquarters with a page of paper in his hand, excitedly shouting to his superior, "Comrade! Comrade! The Americans are using Lisp to write their rocket launching software!"</p>
<p>The commander was skeptical. "How do you know?"</p>
<p>"I broke into their research lab and stole a page from the teletype machine! It's not the whole program, but it's the final page and contains the <strong>concluding</strong> <strong>logic</strong> of the program! See for yourself!!!!"</p>

              Are there any Lisp jokes not involving parentheses? Not that these ones about how many there are aren&#39;t hilarious. How about jokes about the syntax of other languages? I am sure you will find them crazy funny if you like these Lisp jokes.

                <p>A Geologist and an engineer are sitting next to each other on a long flight from LA to NY. The Geologist leans over to the Engineer and asks if he would like to play a fun game. The Engineer just wants to take a nap, so he politely declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks. 
The Geologist persists and explains that the game is real easy and a lotta fun. He explains, "I ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me $5. Then you ask me a question, and if I don't know the answer, I'll pay you $5." Again, the Engineer politely declines and tries to get to sleep. The Geologist now somewhat agitated, says, "OK, if you don't know the answer you pay me $5, and if I don't know the answer, I'll pay you $50!" </p>
<p>This catches the Engineer's attention, and he sees no end to this torment unless he plays, so he agrees to the game. The Geologist asks the first question. "What's the distance from the Earth to the moon?" </p>
<p>The Engineer doesn't say a word, but reaches into his wallet, pulls out a five dollar bill and hands it to the Geologist. </p>
<p>Now, it's the Engineer's turn. He asks the Geologist, "What goes up a hill with three legs, and comes down on four?" The Geologist looks up at him with a puzzled look. He takes out his laptop computer and searches all of his references. He taps into the Airphone with his modem and searches the net and the Library of Congress. Frustrated, he sends e-mail to his co-workers -- all to no avail. </p>
<p>After about an hour, he wakes the Engineer and hands him $50. The Engineer politely takes the $50 and turns away to try to get back to sleep. </p>
<p>The Geologist is more than a little miffed, shakes the Engineer and asks, "Well, so what's the answer?" </p>
<p>Without a word, the Engineer reaches into his wallet, hands the Geologist $5, and turns away to get back to sleep.</p>

                <p>Jesus and Satan have an argument as to who is the better programmer. This goes on for a few hours until they come to an agreement to hold a contest with God as the judge. They set themselves before their computers and begin. They type furiously, lines of code streaming up the screen, for several hours straight.</p>
<p>Seconds before the end of the competition, a bolt of lightning strikes, taking out the electricity. Moments later, the power is restored, and God announces that the contest is over. He asks Satan to show his work. Visibly upset, Satan cries and says, “I have nothing. I lost it all when the power went out.”</p>
<p>“Very well,” says God, “let us see if Jesus has fared any better.”</p>
<p>Jesus presses a key, and the screen comes to life in vivid display, the voices of an angelic choir pour forth from the speakers.</p>
<p>Satan is astonished. He stutters, “B-b-but how?! I lost everything, yet Jesus’ program is intact! How did he do it?”</p>
<p>God chuckles, “Everybody knows… Jesus saves.”</p>

              In c, a string is just an array of characters. They use the \0 character to know when a string ends. Without it, the string wouldn&#39;t have any bounds, an many functions just go on reading passed the end of the string, reading random memory values. - <b> Ikke</b>

<p>"You work for a software company which develops avionics (software that controls the instruments of an airplane). One day you are taking a business trip. As you get on the plane you see a plaque that says this plane is using a beta of the software your team developed. Who would get off?"</p>

                <p>Once upon a time there was a shepherd looking after his sheep on the side of a deserted road. Suddenly a brand new Porsche screeches to a halt. The driver, a man dressed in an Armani suit, Cerutti shoes, Ray-Ban sunglasses, TAG-Heuer wrist-watch, and a Versace tie, gets out and asks the Shepherd:</p>
<p>Man: “If I can tell you how many sheep you have, will you give me one of them?”</p>
<p>The shepherd looks at the young man, and then looks at the large flock of grazing sheep and replies: </p>
<p>Shepherd: “Okay.”</p>
<p>The young man parks the car, connects his laptop to the mobile-fax, enters a NASA Webster, scans the ground using his GPS, opens a database and 60 Excel tables filled with logarithms and pivot tables, then prints out a 150 page report on his high-tech mini-printer. He turns to the shepherd and says,</p>
<p>Man: “You have exactly 1,586 sheep here.”</p>
<p>The shepherd cheers, </p>
<p>Shepherd: “That’s correct, you can have your sheep.”</p>
<p>The young man makes his pick and puts it in the back of his Porsche. The shepherd looks at him and asks,</p>
<p>Shepherd: “If I guess your profession, will you return my animal to me?”</p>
<p>The young man answers; </p>
<p>Man: “Yes, why not?”</p>
<p>Shepherd: "You are an IT consultant."</p>
<p>Man: “How did you know?”</p>
<p>Shepherd: “Very simple. First, you came here without being called. Second, you charged me a fee to tell me something I already knew, and third, you don’t understand anything about my business…Now can I have my <em>DOG</em> back?"</p>

                <p>Joke:
A novice programmer was explained the meaning of RTFM.  He showed up the next day saying: "So I went out and bought the Kama Sutra.  Now what?"</p>
<p>Meta-joke:
If you tell the joke above to a non-programmer, he will ask: "What's RTFM?"  A programmer will ask: "What's Kama Sutra?"</p>
<p>Meta-meta-joke:
If instead of laughing in response in the meta-joke above you have asked "I knew both, now who am I", then you are probably a programmer over the age of 30, who has realized the value of social skills, and who may even be married, but who is still an uber-geek who takes things way too literally.</p>
<p>If you have asked "I googled both, now who am I", then you are probably a high-school kid who reads stackoverflow and takes things way too literally, but who had not yet known about RTFM or Kama Sutra.  Congratulations, you are well on your way to becoming an uber-geek.  Please try to acquire some social skills along the way.  You may not think so now, but they do come in handy.</p>

                <p>How to catch an Elephant in the Africa</p>
<ul>
<li>MATHEMATICIANS hunt elephants by
going to Africa, throwing out
everything that is not an elephant,
and catching one of whatever is
left.</li>
<li>EXPERIENCED MATHEMATICIANS
will attempt to prove the existence
of at least one unique elephant
before proceeding to step 1 as a
subordinate exercise.</li>
<li>PROFESSORS OF MATHEMATICS will prove the existence of at least one unique elephant and then leave the detection and capture of an actual elephant as an exercise for their graduate students.</li>
<li>COMPUTER SCIENTISTS hunt elephants by exercising Algorithm A:
<ol>
<li>Go to Africa.</li>
<li>Start at the Cape of Good Hope.</li>
<li>Work northward in an orderly manner, traversing the continent alternately east and west.</li>
<li>During each traverse pass,
<ol>
<li>Catch each animal seen.</li>
<li>Compare each animal caught to a known elephant.</li>
<li>Stop when a match is detected. </li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li>EXPERIENCED COMPUTER PROGRAMMERS modify Algorithm A by placing a known elephant in Cairo to ensure that the algorithm will terminate.</li>
<li>ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE PROGRAMMERS prefer to execute Algorithm A on their hands and knees.</li>
<li>ENGINEERS hunt elephants by going to Africa, catching gray animals at random, and stopping when any one of them weighs within plus or minus 15 percent of any previously observed elephant.</li>
<li>ECONOMISTS don't hunt elephants, but they believe that if elephants are paid enough, they will hunt themselves.</li>
<li>STATISTICIANS hunt the first animal they see N times and call it an elephant.</li>
<li>CONSULTANTS don't hunt elephants, and many have never hunted anything at all, but they can be hired by the hour to advise those people who do.</li>
<li>OPERATIONS RESEARCH CONSULTANTS can also measure the correlation of hat size and bullet color to the efficiency of elephant-hunting strategies, if someone else will only identify the elephants.</li>
<li>POLITICIANS don't hunt elephants, but they will share the elephants you catch with the people who voted for them.</li>
<li>LAWYERS don't hunt elephants, but they do follow the herds around arguing about who owns the droppings.</li>
<li>SOFTWARE LAWYERS will claim that they own an entire herd based on the look and feel of one dropping.</li>
<li>VICE PRESIDENTS OF ENGINEERING, RESEARCH, AND DEVELOPMENT try hard to hunt elephants, but their staffs are designed to prevent it. When the vice president does get to hunt elephants, the staff will try to ensure that all possible elephants are completely prehunted before the vice president sees them. If the vice president does happen to see a elephant, the staff will:
<ol>
<li>compliment the vice president's keen eyesight and</li>
<li>enlarge itself to prevent any recurrence.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>SENIOR MANAGERS set broad elephant-hunting policy based on the assumption that elephants are just like field mice, but with deeper voices.</li>
<li>QUALITY ASSURANCE INSPECTORS ignore the elephants and look for mistakes the other hunters made when they were packing the jeep.</li>
<li>SALES PEOPLE don't hunt elephants but spend their time selling elephants they haven't caught, for delivery two days before the season opens.</li>
<li>SOFTWARE SALES PEOPLE ship the first thing they catch and write up an invoice for an elephant.</li>
<li>HARDWARE SALES PEOPLE catch rabbits, paint them gray, and sell them as desktop elephants. </li>
</ul>

              I&#39;ll have mercy on Corey and CiNN. It&#39;s a play on the old &quot;why is six afraid of seven? because 7 8 9&quot; joke. The joke doesn&#39;t work in octal (base 8) because the next number after 7 in octal is 10. Thus &quot;7 8 9&quot; becomes &quot;7 10 11&quot; and the pun is lost. - <b> Nathan Strong</b>

              Let the record show that I figured it out on my own, as evidenced by me having written &quot;seven ate nine&quot;. It&#39;s just that I thought, &quot;That couldn&#39;t be it, could it?   It couldn&#39;t be THAT lame, could it?&quot;.  It could and is.

              I&#39;m open to discussion.  I get the joke, but the way it is stated is offensive. (a) It says this is what female programmers <i>are</i>, rather than describing the perception; modifying it with &quot;According to male geeks&quot; might help (b) The reference to age of consent makes it about using her for sex (objectifying), and not about sexiness (which would even be flattering) (c) The reference to necrophilia has the same issue, but more extreme.  Replace &quot;female programmers&quot; with a racial minority, &quot;sexually irresistible&quot; with a racial slur, and &quot;age of consent&quot; with &quot;high school graduation&quot; for an analogy - <b> Ethel Evans</b>

<p>Three women sat discussing their husbands and their sex lives.</p>
<p>"My husband's a wrestler," said the first.  "He's really strong and aggressive in bed."</p>
<p>"My husband's an artist," said the second.  "He's really gentle and sensitive."</p>

              It&#39;s cute quote, but in reality, C allows for much more understandable and maintainable systems to be built compared to assembly. Of course, you should almost always use something higher level than C anyway, but if you were doing some low-level embedded/kernel programming, C is actually pretty good at what it was designed for. - <b> Jason Creighton</b>

                <p>A group of programmers and marketers were traveling to a trade show on a train. Each of the marketers had bought a ticket, but the programmers had only bought one ticket for the lot of them.</p>
<p>One of the programmers was keeping a lookout, and when the conductor neared their car he called out "The conductor's coming!" and all of the programmers piled into the train's lavatory and closed the door. The conductor took the tickets of all of the marketers, and then knocked on the lavatory door and called "Ticket please." The programmers slid their ticket under the door, and the conductor took it and left.</p>
<p>The programmers were laughing at the marketers for the rest of the trip, and the marketers felt like idiots.</p>
<p>On the way back, the marketers decided they would use the same trick and only bought one ticket for them. But this time, the programmers didn't buy a single ticket! Again, one of the programmers kept a lookout for the conductor. When he called "Conductor coming!" all of the programmers piled into one lavatory, and all of the marketers shut themselves into another lavatory.</p>
<p>One programmer came back out of his lavatory, knocked on the other door, and said "Ticket please!"</p>

              @some — That isn&#39;t categorically true. I&#39;ve used a number of computers which had USB keyboards, but for which &quot;Legacy USB support&quot; (i.e. USB support without first booting a USB-aware OS — this was several years ago) was turned off.  On those systems, plugging in your keyboard did absolutely nothing; it wasn&#39;t possible to &quot;CONTINUE&quot;, only to reboot. On the worst ones, it would give &quot;KEYBOARD NOT FOUND&quot; even if a USB keyboard <i>was</i> plugged in; you had to find a PS/2 keyboard to boot at all (and hopefully disable the keyboard warning in the BIOS first so it wouldn&#39;t happen again). - <b> Ben Blank</b>

                <p><strong>Top 10 things likely to be overheard from a Klingon Programmer</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Specifications are for the weak and
timid!</li>
<li>You question the worthiness of my
code? I should kill you where you
stand!</li>
<li>Indentation? I will show you how
to indent when I indent your skull!</li>
<li>What is this talk of release?
Klingons do not release software. Our software escapes
leaving a bloody trail of designers
and quality assurance people in its
wake.</li>
<li>Klingon function calls do not have
parameters - they have arguments
- and they ALWAYS WIN THEM.</li>
<li>Debugging? Klingons do not debug.
Our software does not coddle the
weak.</li>
<li>A True Klingon Warrior does not
comment on his code!</li>
<li>Klingon software does not have BUGS.
It has FEATURES, and those features
are too sophisticated for a Romulan
pig like you to understand.</li>
<li>You cannot truly appreciate Dilbert
unless you've read it in the
original Klingon.</li>
<li>Our users will know fear and cower
 before our software! Ship it! Ship
 it and let them flee like the dogs
 they are!</li>

                <p><strong>The Consultant's Exam</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Q1.  How do you put a giraffe into a refrigerator?</li>
</ul>
<p>(Answer: <em>Open the refrigerator, put in the giraffe, and close the door.</em> )</p>
<p>This question tests whether you tend to do simple things in an overly complicated way.</p>
<ul>
<li>Q2. How do you put an elephant into a refrigerator?  (and No, it is not "Open the refigerator, put in the elephant and close the refrigerator?")</li>
</ul>
<p>(Answer: <em>Open the refrigerator, take out the giraffe, put in the elephant and close the door.</em>)
This tests your ability to think through the repercussions of your previous actions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Q3.  The Lion King is hosting an animal conference.  All the animals attend, except one. Which animal does not attend?</li>
</ul>
<p>(Answer:  <em>The elephant.  The elephant is in the refrigerator.</em>)
This tests your memory.</p>
<p>Okay, even if you did not answer the first three questions correctly, you still have one more chance to show your true analytical abilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Q4. There is a river you must cross but it is used by crocodiles, and you do not have a boat. How do you manage it?</li>
</ul>
<p>(Answer:  <em>You just jump into the river and swim across. All the crocodiles are attending the Lion King's Meeting.</em>)</p>

                <p>OK. Here's one I actually wrote myself about 15 years ago. It's archived online at <a href="http://www.adapower.com/index.php?Command=Class&amp;ClassID=Humor&amp;CID=8" rel="nofollow">

</a>
<sup style="font-size:9px">[1]</sup>. Be gentle:</p>
<p>////////////////////////////</p>
<p>I run across these lists everywhere. Unfortunately, they all seem to have been done by some brain-damaged soul who thinks C is a "normal" language. So I have made an attempt to come up with a new list that is a little more accurate, at least where I sit. </p>
<p>Ada : 
You aim at your foot and pull the trigger, but the safety stops the gun from firing. The safety won't budge until you tag your foot with a sign reading "Bullet Hole in this foot", and call the paramedics. You do so, then shoot yourself in the foot. </p>
<p>C : 
The gun comes in 38 pieces, with a set of assembly instructions. After painstakingly assembling the pieces, you pull the trigger and the gun promptly backfires and blows your head off. </p>
<p>Assembly : 
The same as C, except you have to hand-machine all the pieces as well. When you pull the trigger, your whole house explodes. </p>
<p>Java: 
You break into someone else's home and steal their water pistol. You then make a child gun that uses .38 rounds instead of water. When you pull the trigger on the child gun, nothing happens to you, but everyone who visits your house gets shot in the foot. </p>
<p>Basic : 
You aim the gun at a straight horizontal and pull the trigger, which causes a stream of water to be squirted straight down onto your foot. </p>
<p>Perl : 
You aim the gun at your foot and pull the trigger. There is no explosion, but gravity causes the bullet to slide out of the barrel and bounce off your foot. </p>
<p>Lisp : 
You do a small part of the remaining work involved in shooting yourself in the foot. You then call yourself, and tell yourself to shoot yourself in the foot. </p>
<p>Pascal : 
The same as Ada, except when you pull the trigger a little sign pops out reading "BANG!". </p>
<p>C++ : 
The same as Java, except you try to build the parent water pistol using the gun tools from the C gun. When you pull the trigger on the child gun, the parent C gun explodes, spraying water everywhere, including the chamber of the child gun. This causes the child gun to backfire, blowing your head off. </p>
<p>Visual C++ : 
The same as C++, except that the bullets, the gun parts, the tools you use to put it together, the hospital you get taken to afterwards, and the ambulance that takes you there are all owned by the same company. </p>
<p>APL : 
Whenever you pull the trigger, no matter where you aim the gun, the bullet ricochets off of 13 objects and lodges in your foot. The gun has been examined by ballistics experts, mechanical engineers, and even the person who made it, and none of them can figure out how it works. </p>
<p>FORTRAN : 
When you aim the gun at your foot and pull the trigger, a table indexing error causes the gun to shoot its firing pin into your foot instead of the bullet. </p>
<p><hr /></p>
<p>In the year since I posted this, the comments have grown to the point where I think they are as valuable as my original answer. Currently there are comments proposing entries for the following languages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actionscript</li>
<li>Applescript</li>
<li>Bash </li>
<li>C# (2)</li>
<li>Erlang</li>
<li>INTERCAL</li>
<li>Java script</li>
<li>Objective-C / Smalltalk</li>
<li>PHP</li>
<li>Python (5)</li>
<li>Ruby</li>
<li>SQL</li>
<li>TCL</li>
<li>Visual Basic</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also two alternate entries for Perl, and one for C++</p>

              Ilya: Barmen often don&#39;t know how to add something that seems to be infinite. The solution to such a problem is s = (a1)/(1-k). Where a1 is the first number, and k is the constant rate of increase or decrease. k&lt;1 means convergence, so you get s = (1)/(1-0,5) = 2 (If I&#39;m not mistaken) - <b> Jonta</b>

              Typical mathematicians - thinking they drink beer in lab conditions, ignoring reality - it takes time to pass the glass to the next guy, so it cannot take only 2 minutes! And, by that time, the beer will be warm, so noone will want to drink it. Well, except maybe for mathematicians... - <b> AviD</b>

                <p><strong>Intelligent Design Sort</strong></p>
<p><em>Introduction</em></p>
<p>Intelligent design sort is a sorting algorithm based on the theory of intelligent design.</p>
<p><em>Algorithm Description</em></p>
<p>The probability of the original input list being in the exact order it's in is 1/(n!). There is such a small likelihood of this that it's clearly absurd to say that this happened by chance, so it must have been consciously put in that order by an intelligent Sorter. Therefore it's safe to assume that it's already optimally Sorted in some way that transcends our naïve mortal understanding of "ascending order". Any attempt to change that order to conform to our own preconceptions would actually make it less sorted.</p>
<p><em>Analysis</em></p>
<p>This algorithm is constant in time, and sorts the list in-place, requiring no additional memory at all. In fact, it doesn't even require any of that suspicious technological computer stuff. Praise the Sorter!</p>

              Just because someone caused/created a collection in the original order doesn&#39;t mean that order is always the ideal sorted order. Every list is created/generated by someone or something. A list can be &quot;out of order&quot; based on other criteria. In a sense, all lists are originally created to be &quot;sorted&quot; based on some criteria (the criteria used to select/create the list). - <b> Josh G</b>

              So would this sorting algorithm be O(0), since it actually doesn&#39;t have to do anything and thus takes <i>no</i> time to sort it? - <b> gnovice</b>

              <div class="comment">
               (3)    
              @gnovice - It is O(1). Big-O notation does not take into account the actual time for the algorithm to do it&#39;s dirty work - just how the algorithm scales, so O(1) is constant - it takes the same amount of time for all inputs and O(n) takes twice as long for double-sized inputs. The point is that an O(n) algorithm can be faster than an O(1) one for some inputs, because the O(n) one might be &quot;quick-and-dirty&quot; and the O(1) might jump through some hoops. There is still a constant multiplier for time, and in this case, that multiplier would be 0. - <b> Chris Lutz</b>

                <p>An architect, a hooker and a programmer were talking one evening, and
  somehow, the discussion turned to which profession was the oldest.</p>
<p>"Come on, you guys!  Everyone knows mine is the oldest profession,"
  said the hooker.</p>
<p>"Ah," said the architect, "but before your profession existed, there
  had to be people, and who was there before people?"</p>
<p>"What are you getting at, God?"  The hooker asked.</p>
<p>"And was He not the divine architect of the universe?" The architect
  asked, looking smug.</p>
<p>The programmer had been silent, but now he spoke up.  "And before God
  took on himself the role of an architect, what was there?"</p>
<p>"Darkness and chaos," the hooker said.</p>
<p>"And who do you think created chaos?" the programmer said.</p>

                <p>So a programming team developes true AI capable of thinking, reasoning, and feeling.  They wrote all the code in Scheme  They go to their project manager and tell him of their invention and invite him to come talk to it.  He agrees and sits down at the terminal they point to.  He types:</p>
<pre><code>Hello
</code></pre>
<p>and it replies:</p>
<pre><code>(Hello)
</code></pre>
<p>He types:</p>
<pre><code>How are you?
</code></pre>
<p>It replies:</p>
<pre><code>((I'm fine, thanks)(How are you?))
</code></pre>
<p>The PM gets up and tells the team he hates the program and that he's ending the project.  The team starts pleading with him, asking how he could hate a true AI capable of feelings and reason.  They tell him it can think, solve problems, and even work as a member of the team.<br />
The PM replies, "Yes, but it talks with a Lisp."</p>

                <p>I was in the airport VIP lounge in route to Seattle a couple of weeks ago. While in there, I noticed Bill Gates sitting comfortably in the corner, enjoying a drink.
I was meeting a very important client who was also flying to Seattle, but she was running a little bit late.</p>
<p>Well, being a straightforward kind of guy, I approached the Microsoft chairman, introduced myself, and said, "Mr. Gates, I wonder if you would do me a favor."</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"I'm sitting right over there," pointing to my seat at the bar, "and I'm waiting on a very important client. Would you be so kind when she arrives as to come walk by and just say, 'Hi, Ray,'?"</p>
<p>"Sure."</p>
<p>I shook his hand and thanked him and went back to my seat.</p>
<p>About ten minutes later, my client showed up. We ordered a drink and started to talk business.</p>
<p>A couple of minutes later, I felt a tap on my shoulder. It was Bill Gates.</p>
<p>"Hi, Ray," he said.</p>
<p>I replied, "Get lost Gates, I'm in a meeting."</p>

                <p>A programmer and a business analyst are sitting in the break room one day eating lunch when suddenly the microwave catches fire. Thinking quickly, the analyst leaps up, unplugs the microwave, grabs the trash can, fills it with water from sink, and dumps the water on the microwave to put out the flames.</p>
<p>A few weeks later the two are again having lunch in the break room when suddenly the coffee maker bursts into flames. The programmer leaps up, grabs the coffee maker, shoves it into the microwave oven, and then hands the trash can to the business analyst, thus re-using the solution developed for the previous project.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Robin Hood And Friar Tuck</strong></p>
<p>The following story was posted in
  news.sysadmin recently.</p>
<p>The more things change, the more they
  stay the same...</p>
<p>Back in the mid-1970s, several of the
  system support staff at Motorola (I
  believe it was) discovered a
  relatively simple way to crack system
  security on the Xerox CP-V timesharing
  system (or it may have been CP-V's
  predecessor UTS).  Through a simple
  programming strategy, it was possible
  for a user program to trick the system
  into running a portion of the program
  in "master mode" (supervisor state),
  in which memory protection does not
  apply.  The program could then poke a
  large value into its "privilege level"
  byte (normally write-protected) and
  could then proceed to bypass all
  levels of security within the
  file-management system, patch the
  system monitor, and do numerous other
  interesting things.  In short, the
  barn door was wide open.</p>
<p>Motorola quite properly reported this
  problem to XEROX via an official
  "level 1 SIDR" (a bug report with a
  perceived urgency of "needs to be
  fixed yesterday").  Because the text
  of each SIDR was entered into a
  database that could be viewed by quite
  a number of people, Motorola followed
  the approved procedure: they simply
  reported the problem as "Security
  SIDR", and attached all of the
  necessary documentation,
  ways-to-reproduce, etc. separately.</p>
<p>Xerox apparently sat on the problem...
  they either didn't acknowledge the
  severity of the problem, or didn't
  assign the necessary
  operating-system-staff resources to
  develop and distribute an official
  patch.</p>
<p>Time passed (months, as I recall). 
  The Motorola guys pestered their Xerox
  field-support rep, to no avail.
  Finally they decided to take Direct
  Action, to demonstrate to Xerox
  management just how easily the system
  could be cracked, and just how
  thoroughly the system security systems
  could be subverted.</p>
<p>They dug around through the
  operating-system listings, and devised
  a thoroughly devilish set of patches. 
  These patches were then incorporated
  into a pair of programs called Robin
  Hood and Friar Tuck.  Robin Hood and
  Friar Tuck were designed to run as
  "ghost jobs" (daemons, in Unix
  terminology); they would use the
  existing loophole to subvert system
  security, install the necessary
  patches, and then keep an eye on one
  another's statuses in order to keep
  the system operator (in effect, the
  superuser) from aborting them.</p>
<p>So... one day, the system operator on
  the main CP-V software-development
  system in El Segundo was surprised by
  a number of unusual phenomena.  These
  included the following (as I recall...
  it's been a while since I heard the
  story):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Tape drives would rewind and dismount their tapes in the   middle
  of a job.</p></li>
<li><p>Disk drives would seek back&amp;forth so rapidly that they'd   attempt to walk
  across the floor.</p></li>
<li><p>The card-punch output device would occasionally start up   of itself and
  punch a "lace card" (every hole
  punched).   These would usually jam in
  the punch.</p></li>
<li><p>The console would print snide and insulting messages from   Robin Hood
  to Friar Tuck, or vice versa.</p></li>
<li><p>The Xerox card reader had two output stackers; it could be   instructed to
  stack into A, stack into B, or stack
  into A   unless a card was unreadable,
  in which case the bad card   was
  placed into stacker B.  One of the
  patches installed   by the ghosts
  added some code to the card-reader
  driver...   after reading a card, it
  would flip over to the opposite<br />
  stacker.  As a result, card decks
  would divide themselves   in half when
  they were read, leaving the operator
  to   recollate them manually.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I believe that there were some other
  effects produced, as well.</p>
<p>Naturally, the operator called in the
  operating-system developers.  They
  found the bandit ghost jobs running,
  and X'ed them... and were once again
  surprised.  When Robin Hood was X'ed,
  the following sequence of events took
  place:</p>
<p>!X id1</p>
<p>id1:   Friar Tuck... I am under
  attack!  Pray save me!  (Robin Hood)<br />
  id1: Off (aborted)</p>
<p>id2: Fear not, friend Robin!  I
  shall rout the Sheriff of Nottingham's
  men!</p>
<p>id3: Thank you, my good fellow!
  (Robin)</p>
<p>Each ghost-job would detect the fact
  that the other had been killed, and
  would start a new copy of the
  recently-slain program within a few
  milliseconds.  The only way to kill
  both ghosts was to kill them
  simultaneously (very difficult) or to
  deliberately crash the system.</p>
<p>Finally, the system programmers did
  the latter... only to find that the
  bandits appeared once again when the
  system rebooted!  It turned out that
  these two programs had patched the
  boot-time image (the /vmunix file, in
  Unix terms) and had added themselves
  to the list of programs that were to
  be started at boot time...</p>
<p>The Robin Hood and Friar Tuck ghosts
  were finally eradicated when the
  system staff rebooted the system from
  a clean boot-tape and reinstalled the
  monitor.  Not long thereafter, Xerox
  released a patch for this problem.</p>
<p>I believe that Xerox filed a complaint
  with Motorola's management about the
  merry-prankster actions of the two
  employees in question.  To the best of
  my knowledge, no serious disciplinary
  action was taken against either of
  these guys.</p>
<p>Several years later, both of the
  perpetrators were hired by Honeywell,
  which had purchased the rights to CP-V
  after Xerox pulled out of the
  mainframe business.  Both of them made
  serious and substantial contributions
  to the Honeywell CP-6 operating system
  development effort.  Robin Hood (Dan
  Holle) did much of the development of
  the PL-6 system-programming language
  compiler; Friar Tuck (John Gabler) was
  one of the chief
  communications-software gurus for
  several years.  They're both alive and
  well, and living in LA (Dan) and
  Orange County (John).  Both are among
  the more brilliant people I've had the
  pleasure of working with.</p>
<p>Disclaimers: it has been quite a while
  since I heard the details of how this
  all went down, so some of the details
  above are almost certainly wrong.  I
  shared an apartment with John Gabler
  for several years, and he was my Best
  Man when I married back in '86... so
  I'm somewhat predisposed to believe
  his version of the events that
  occurred.</p>

              My grandpa told me a non-CS variant of this several years ago. It went something like this:

A young man finds a genie&#39;s lamp. He rubs it, and out pops the genie. &quot;For freeing me from the lamp, I shall grant you one wish,&quot; the genie says.

The man thinks for a moment, then says &quot;I wish for a road to Hawaii.&quot;

The genie gasps. &quot;What a thing to ask for! Even for me it would take years to complete! Do you have a simpler wish?&quot;

The man thinks long and hard this time, then he says &quot;I wish to understand women.&quot;

The genie looks at the man, sighs, and says &quot;You want two or four lanes on that road?&quot; - <b> bcat</b>

                <p>This is one I've been telling for years and I'm always surprised when people haven't heard it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Three programmers meet accidentally at
  the urinal while attending a technical
  conference.  The first programmer
  finishes up his business, washes his
  hands with loads of water, walks over
  to the towels and uses almost the
  entire roll to dry his hands.  He
  turns to the other two and says <em>"At
  Microsoft, we are trained to be
  extremely thorough."</em></p>
<p>The second
  programmer finishes up, walks over to
  the sink and washes his hands with
  much less water, then uses a single
  towel to dry his hands.  He remarks to
  the other two <em>"At IBM, we are trained
  not only to be very thorough, but also
  very efficient."</em></p>
<p>The third programmer
  finishes his business, walks right
  past the sink and towel rack and lauds
  over his shoulder as he walks out the
  door: <em>"At Apple we don't piss on our
  hands!"</em></p>

                <p>A mathematician, a physicist, a civil engineer, and a computer programmer are asked (after a few beers) to show that all odd numbers greater than 1 are prime.</p>
<p><strong>Mathematician:</strong> 3 is prime, 5 is prime, by induction they're all prime.</p>
<p><strong>Physicist:</strong> 3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime, 9 is... experimental error, 11 is prime, 13 is prime -- clearly, they're all prime.</p>
<p><strong>Civil Engineer:</strong> 3 is prime, 5 is prime 7 is prime, 9 is prime, 11 is prime -- sure, they're all prime.</p>
<p><strong>Programmer:</strong> 3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime, 7 is prime, 7 is prime, 7 is prime, 7 is prime......</p>

<h1><strong>PROGRAMMER'S NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS</strong></h1>
<p>'Twas the night before implementation and all through the house,<br />
not a program was working not even a browse.<br />
The programmers hung by their tubes in despair,<br />
with hopes that a miracle would soon be there.</p>
<p>The users were nestled all snug in their beds,<br />
while visions of inquiries danced in their heads.<br />
When out in the machine room there arose such a clatter,<br />
I sprang from my desk to see what was the matter.</p>
<p>And what to my wondering eyes should appear,<br />
but a super programmer (with a six-pack of beer).<br />
His resume glowed with experience so rare,<br />
he turned out great code with a bit-pusher's flair.</p>
<p>More rapid than eagles, his programs they came,<br />
On update! on add! on inquiry! on delete!<br />
on batch jobs! on closing! on functions complete!<br />
His eyes were glazed-over, fingers nimble and lean,<br />
from weekends and nights in front of a screen.</p>
<p>A wink of his eye, and a twitch of his head,<br />
soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.<br />
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,<br />
turning specs into code; then turned with a jerk;</p>
<p>And laying his finger upon the "ENTER" key,<br />
the systems came up and worked perfectly.<br />
The updates updated; the deletes, they deleted;<br />
the inquiries inquired, and closings completed.</p>
<p>He tested each whistle, and tested each bell,<br />
with nary an abend, and all had gone well.<br />
The system was finished, the tests were concluded.<br />
The users' last changes were even included.</p>
<p>And the user exclaimed with a snarl and a taunt,<br />
"It's just what I asked for, but not what I want!"</p>

              <div class="answer">
                <p>A year ago I upgraded from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0 and I have observed that this new program started an unexpected subroutine called Son, which occupies almost all my space and important resources. Also, Wife 1.0 auto-installs as a host in all my programs and auto-starts every time I want to use any of them. Apps like Beers With Friends 10.3 and Sunday Football 5.0 no longer work.</p>
<p>Every now and then, a spyware program called In-Law 1.0 starts and freezes Wife 1.0. I haven't been able to uninstall this spyware and I cannot minimize Wife 1.0 if I want to run any of my favorite apps. I'm thinking about downgrading to Girlfriend 7.0 but uninstall IS NOT WORKING!!! Please Help!!</p>
<p>SUPPORT RESPONSE:</p>
<p>Dear User:</p>
<p>This is a known bug submitted by users. In most cases the source is pretty simple. Many users go from version Girlfriend X.0 to Wife 1.0 thinking Wife 1.0 is an utilities and entertainment app. However, Wife 1.0 is designed to control the system entirely. It is very unlikely that you'll be able to uninstall Wife 1.0 and return to any version of Girlfriend. There are hidden files on Girlfriend X.0 that will make it work just like Wife 1.0.</p>
<p>Some users have tried clean formatting their systems in order to install Girlfriend Plus 1.0 or Wife 2.0 but ended with bigger problems afterwards. Please refer to the warning section on the read-me file, specifically the alimony chapter.</p>
<p>Also, if you update to Girlfriend 8.0, do not update to Wife 2.0 because problems will be worst, expensive and not recommended for normal users. Frequently used upgrades include Celibacy 1.0 or Gay/Lesbian 5.3.</p>
<p>I personally have Wife 1.0 installed and suggest you explore the manual in its entirety. The user agreement states that the user shall be responsible for any problem, no matter the cause. A really powerful command, which normally un-freezes the application can be found under C:/IMSORRY.EXE. Having said that, Wife 1.0 is really interesting but has very expensive updates. Recommended plugins include Flowers 12.0, Jewels 2.3 and Vacations 2.3. Yeshoney 9.0 and Whateveryousay 12.3 are also very popular.</p>
<p>Finally, Wife 1.0 is not compatible with MiniSkirtSecretary 3.3. Installing it can cause irreversible damage to the operating system.</p>

              I think I have a 0.97b version of Wife. There are some bugs, but the development stopped. I&#39;ve got the source code, but I don&#39;t know what language it is. I try to figure out, but there is no time for debugging because I compiled a Daughter (bugs, beta etc) with this version of Wife. I am expecting a working Son until January.

              I am really unknown to wife1.0, but have very little user experience with GirlFriend7.0. I don&#39;t know what a technology Wife1.x is and I am surprised why I see everywhere that people ultimately end up with registering with Wife1.x. Perhaps addiction to the trend? Anyway, I am very seriously concerned that someone take lead role in development of something new that comprises of the best of both Girlfriend7.0 and Wife1.x. This may need expensive resources but will surely be a big hit.

And at the last, could there be something like GFwitter (mini-WifeBook)? Sure to be another big hit, if any! - <b> sangam</b>

              The problem is that she needs a switch statement. switch(dailyActivity){case &quot;sit and type all day&quot;: print &quot;I&#39;m going to sit and type.&quot;; break; case &quot;go out with you&quot;: print &quot;I&#39;m going to go out with you, of course.

                <p>The programmer compiled an array of reasons as to why he can't find a
girlfriend with a good <code>&lt;HEAD&gt;</code> on her <code>&lt;BODY&gt;</code>, reason 0 being that he has
limited cache.  So he searches his memory to recall connecting to the TCP/IP
tunnel of his last girlfriend - sometimes even without a secure socket.  His
last girlfriend always complained about his lack of comments. He fumed, "I
hate commenting!"  Realizing it was a program requirement, he told her she
had nice bits.  This resulted in a Syntax Error.  Now she demanded a
massage, but this was rejected as "Feature Creep."  He smacked her back-end
and shouted, "Who's your parent node?!"  He scanned for open ports.  He
attempted to install a backdoor worm but her response was 403.  While his
data uploaded into her input device, she considered terminating the process.
But instead she initiated a Do While loop where she recalled a previous
boyfriend with a larger pointer.  To expedite the routine routine, she
screamed, "Hack into my system! Hack deep into my system! You're 1337,
baby!"  This caused his stack to overflow, and he shot his GUI on her
interface.</p>

              Actually, the confusion was the word &#39;holds&#39;. IMO, &#39;raises&#39; might be a better word here. May be I am wrong, not an English native. I was holding my two fingers with my other hand, and didn&#39;t really understand this act. Nice joke though. - <b> Adeel Ansari</b>

                <h2>Electrical Engineering vs. Computer Science</h2>
<p>Wire wrapped board. Once upon a time, in a kingdom not far from here, a king summoned two of his advisors for a test. He showed them both a shiny metal box with two slots in the top, a control knob, and a lever. "What do you think this is?"</p>
<p>One advisor, an engineer, answered first. "It is a toaster," he said. The king asked, "How would you design an embedded computer for it?" The engineer replied, "Using a four-bit microcontroller, I would write a simple program that reads the darkness knob and quantizes its position to one of 16 shades of darkness, from snow white to coal black. The program would use that darkness level as the index to a 16-element table of initial timer values. Then it would turn on the heating elements and start the timer with the initial value selected from the table. At the end of the time delay, it would turn off the heat and pop up the toast. Come back next week, and I'll show you a working prototype."</p>
<p>The second advisor, a computer scientist, immediately recognized the danger of such short-sighted thinking. He said, "Toasters don't just turn bread into toast, they are also used to warm frozen waffles. What you see before you is really a breakfast food cooker. As the subjects of your kingdom become more sophisticated, they will demand more capabilities. They will need a breakfast food cooker that can also cook sausage, fry bacon, and make scrambled eggs. A toaster that only makes toast will soon be obsolete. If we don't look to the future, we will have to completely redesign the toaster in just a few years."</p>
<p>"With this in mind, we can formulate a more intelligent solution to the problem. First, create a class of breakfast foods. Specialize this class into subclasses: grains, pork, and poultry. The specialization process should be repeated with grains divided into toast, muffins, pancakes, and waffles; pork divided into sausage, links, and bacon; and poultry divided into scrambled eggs, hard- boiled eggs, poached eggs, fried eggs, and various omelet classes."</p>
<p>"The ham and cheese omelet class is worth special attention because it must inherit characteristics from the pork, dairy, and poultry classes. Thus, we see that the problem cannot be properly solved without multiple inheritance. At run time, the program must create the proper object and send a message to the object that says, 'Cook yourself.' The semantics of this message depend, of course, on the kind of object, so they have a different meaning to a piece of toast than to scrambled eggs."</p>
<p>"Reviewing the process so far, we see that the analysis phase has revealed that the primary requirement is to cook any kind of breakfast food. In the design phase, we have discovered some derived requirements. Specifically, we need an object-oriented language with multiple inheritance. Of course, users don't want the eggs to get cold while the bacon is frying, so concurrent processing is required, too."</p>
<p>"We must not forget the user interface. The lever that lowers the food lacks versatility, and the darkness knob is confusing. Users won't buy the product unless it has a user-friendly, graphical interface. When the breakfast cooker is plugged in, users should see a cowboy boot on the screen. Users click on it, and the message 'Booting UNIX v.8.3' appears on the screen. (UNIX 8.3 should be out by the time the product gets to the market.) Users can pull down a menu and click on the foods they want to cook."</p>
<p>"Having made the wise decision of specifying the software first in the design phase, all that remains is to pick an adequate hardware platform for the implementation phase. An Intel 80386 with 8MB of memory, a 30MB hard disk, and a VGA monitor should be sufficient. If you select a multitasking, object oriented language that supports multiple inheritance and has a built-in GUI, writing the program will be a snap. (Imagine the difficulty we would have had if we had foolishly allowed a hardware-first design strategy to lock us into a four-bit microcontroller!)."</p>
<p>The king wisely had the computer scientist beheaded, and they all lived happily ever after. </p>

<p>Puzzled, the analyst finished unpacking and then went and sat down on the porch.  Soon he could hear rustling noises in the forest.

<p>"Open the door!", screamed the salesman.</p>
<p>The analyst whipped open the door, and the salesman ran to the door, suddenly stopped, and stepped aside.  The bear, unable to stop, continued through the door and into the cabin.

                <p>For a study in problem solving, a programmer and a mathematician are each put into test kitchens and asked to boil water.  At the start of the study, each grabs a pencil and start scribbling notes furiously, covering the walls and counters with UML diagrams, heat exchange equations, proofs of completeness and so on.  After several hours of sweat, each picks up a pot, fills it with water at the sink, puts it on the stove, turns on the burner and waits.</p>
<p>Then the kitchens are cleaned out and they're given the same task, except this time the pot already has water in it and is sitting on the stove.  The programmer grabs his pencil and starts drawing out class hierachies, designs a metalanguage with a LALR parser, and continues covering the kitchen with notes.  Finally the programmer turns on the burner and waits.</p>
<p>The mathematician stares at the pot for a few minutes, picks it up and dumps it out and writes on the counter, "reduced to a problem already solved."</p>

                <p>Not quite CS, but I'm sure it can be appreciated here:</p>
<p>"An engineer, a physicist and a mathematician find themselves in an anecdote, indeed an anecdote quite similar to many that you have no doubt already heard.</p>
<p>After some observations and rough calculations the engineer realizes the situation and starts laughing.</p>
<p>A few minutes later the physicist understands too and chuckles to himself happily as he now has enough experimental evidence to publish a paper.</p>
<p>This leaves the mathematician somewhat perplexed, as he had observed right away that he was the subject of an anecdote, and deduced quite rapidly the presence of humour from similar anecdotes, but considers this anecdote to be too trivial a corollary to be significant, let alone funny."</p>

                <p>A UNIX wizard hears cries of torment from his apprentice's computer room where the apprentice is studying, and goes to investigate.</p>
<p>He finds the apprentice in obvious distress, nearly on the verge of tears. "What's the problem?" he asks. "Why did you cry out?"</p>
<p>"It's terrible using this system. I must use four editors each day to get my studies done, because not one of them does everything."</p>
<p>The wizard nods sagely, and asks, "And what would you propose that will solve this obvious dilemma?"</p>
<p>The student thinks carefully for several minutes, and his face then lights up in delight. Excitedly, he says, "Well, it's obvious. I will write the best editor ever. It will do everything that the existing four editors do, but do their jobs better, and faster. And because of my new editor, the world will be a better place."</p>
<p>The wizard quickly raises his hand and smacks the apprentice on the side of his head. The wizard is old and frail, and the apprentice isn't physically hurt, but is shocked by what has happened. He turns his head to face the wizard. "What have I done wrong?" he asks.</p>
<p>"Fool!" says the wizard. "Do you think I want to learn yet another editor?"</p>
<p>Immediately, the apprentice is enlightened. </p>

                <p>There are three books of <em>Murphy's Law</em>, by Arthur Bloch, from the early 80's.  A number of my favorites are found in those three volumes:</p>
<h2>Osborn's Law</h2>
<p>Variables won't; Constants aren't.</p>
<h2>Laws of Computer Programming</h2>
<ol>
<li>Any given program, when running, is obsolete.</li>
<li>Any given program costs more and takes longer.</li>
<li>If a program is useful, it will have to be changed.</li>
<li>If a program is useless, it will have to be documented.</li>
<li>Any given program will expand to fill all available memory.</li>
<li>The value of a given program is proportional to the weight of its output.</li>
<li>Program complexity grows until it exceeds the capability of the programmer to maintain it.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Troutman's Postulates (5 &amp; 6)</h2>
<ol>
<li>If the input editor has been designed to reject all bad input, an ingenious idiot will discover a method to get bad data past it.</li>
<li>Profanity is the one language all programmers know best.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Lubarsky's Law of Cybernetic Entomology</h2>
<p>There's always one more bug.</p>

The Physician remarked, “Well, in the Bible, it says that God created Eve from a rib taken out of Adam. This clearly requires surgery, and so I can rightly claim that mine is the oldest profession in the world”.</p>
<p>The Civil Engineer interrupted, and said, “But even earlier in the book of Genesis, it states that God created the order of heavens and earth from out of chaos. This was the first and certainly the most spectacular application of Civil Engineering. Therefore, fair doctor, you are wrong; mine is the oldest profession in the world”.</p>
<p>The Computer Scientist leaned back in her chair, smiled, and then said confidentially, “Ah, but who do you think created the chaos?”</p>

                <p>The local bar was so sure that its bartender was the strongest man around that they offered a $1000 bet. The bartender would squeeze a lemon until all the juice ran into a glass, and hand the lemon to a patron. Anyone who could squeeze one more drop of juice out would win the money. Many people like weight-lifters, wrestlers, body builders, etc had tried over time, but nobody could do it.</p>
<p>One day this scrawny little man came in, wearing thick glasses and a safari suit, and said in a tiny, squeaky voice, "I'd like to try the bet." After the laughter had died down, the bartender said OK, grabbed a lemon, and squeezed away. Then he handed the wrinkled remains of the rind to the little man.
But the crowd's laughter turned to total silence as the man clenched his fist around the lemon and 5-6 drops fell into the glass. As the crowd cheered, the bartender paid the $1000, and asked the little man, "What do you do for a living?</p>
<p>Are you a weight-lifter, or what?"</p>
<p>"No," replied the man.</p>

<p>The farmer asks what is the best way to construct a fence that will contain his livestock (ie., most area for least perimeter).

              Because the last phrase, you usually say &#39;one knew C&#39; and/or &#39;one could C&#39; and knew/could is the same word in Swedish (kunde) in this context, so it makes the play on words more straightforward. - <b> Marcus Lindblom</b>

                <p>One day a Novice came to the Master.<br />
"Master," he said, "How is it that I may become a Writer of Programs?".<br />
The Master looked solemnly at the Novice.<br />
"Have you in your possession a Compiler of Source Code?" the Master asked.<br />
"No," replied the Novice. The Master sent the Novice on a quest to the Store of Software.<br />
Many hours later the Novice returned.<br />
"Master," he said, "How is it that I may become a Writer of Programs?".<br />
The Master looked solemnly at the Novice.<br />
"Have you in your possession a Compiler of Source Code?" the Master asked.<br />
"Yes," replied the Novice.<br />
The Master frowned at the Novice.<br />
"You have a Compiler of Source. What now can prevent you from becoming a Writer of Programs?".<br />
The Novice fidgeted nervously and presented his Compiler of Source to the Master.<br />
"How is this used?" asked the Novice.<br />
"Have you in your possession a Manual of Operation?" the Master asked.<br />
"No," replied the Novice.<br />
The Master instructed the Novice as to where he could find the Manual of Operation.<br />
Many days later the Novice returned.<br />
"Master," he said, "How is it that I may become a Writer of Programs?".<br />
The Master looked solemnly at the Novice.<br />
"Have you in your possession a Compiler of Source Code?" the Master asked.<br />
"Yes," replied the Novice.<br />
"Have you in your possession a Manual of Operation?" the Master asked.<br />
"Yes," replied the Novice.<br />
The Master frowned at the Novice.<br />
"You have a Compiler of Source, and a Manual of Operation. What now can prevent you from becoming a Writer of Programs?".<br />
At this the Novice fidgeted nervously and presented his Manual of Operations to the Master.<br />
"How is this used?" asked the Novice.<br />
The Master closed his eyes, and heaved a great sigh.<br />
The Master sent the Novice on a quest to the School of Elementary.<br />
Many years later the Novice returned.<br />
"Master," he said, "How is it that I may become a Writer of Programs?".<br />
The Master looked solemnly at the Novice.<br />
"Have you in your possession a Compiler of Source Code, a Manual of Operation and an Education of Elementary?" the Master asked.<br />
"Yes," replied the Novice.<br />
The Master frowned at the Novice.<br />
"What then can prevent you from becoming a Writer of Programs?".<br />
The Novice fidgeted nervously. He looked around but could find nothing to present to the Master.<br />
The Master smiled at the Novice.<br />
"I see what problem plagues you." said the Master.<br />
"Oh great master, please tell me." asked the Novice.<br />
The Master turned the Novice toward the door, and with a supportive hand on his shoulder said, "Go young Novice, and Read The F***ing Manual." And so the Novice became enlightened.</p>

                <p>One of my favorites from days gone by:</p>
<p>A poem based on E. A. Poe's The Raven.
By Anonymous</p>
<pre>
Once upon a midnight dreary, fingers cramped and vision bleary,
System manuals piled high and wasted paper on the floor,
Longing for the warmth of bed sheets, still I sat there doing spreadsheets.
Having reached the bottom line I took a floppy from the drawer
I then invoked the SAVE command and waited for the disk to store,
Only this and nothing more.

Deep into the monitor peering, long I sat there wond'ring, fearing.
Doubting, while the disk kept churning, turning yet to churn some more.
But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token.
"Save!" I said, "You cursed mother! Save my data from before!"
One thing did the phosphors answer, only this and nothing more,
Just, "Abort, Retry, Ignore?"

Was this some occult illusion, some maniacal intrusion?
These were choices undesired, ones I'd never faced before.
Carefully I weighed the choices as the disk made impish noises.
The cursor flashed, insistent, waiting, baiting me to type some more.
Clearly I must press a key, choosing one and nothing more,
From "Abort, Retry, Ignore?"

With fingers pale and trembling, slowly toward the keyboard bending,
Longing for a happy ending, hoping all would be restored,
Praying for some guarantee, timidly, I pressed a key.
But on the screen there still persisted words appearing as before.
Ghastly grim they blinked and taunted, haunted, as my patience wore,
Saying "Abort, Retry, Ignore?"

I tried to catch the chips off guard, and pressed again, but twice as hard.
I pleaded with the cursed machine: I begged and cried and then I swore.
Now in mighty desperation, trying random combinations,
Still there came the incantation, just as senseless as before.
Cursor blinking, angrily winking, blinking nonsense as before.
Reading, "Abort, Retry, Ignore?"

There I sat, distraught, exhausted, by my own machine accosted.
Getting up I turned away and paced across the office floor.
And then I saw a dreadful sight: a lightning bolt cut through the night.
A gasp of horror overtook me, shook me to my very core.
The lightning zapped my previous data, lost and gone forevermore.
Not even, "Abort, Retry, Ignore?"

To this day I do not know the place to which lost data go.
What demonic nether world is wrought where lost data will be stored,
Beyond the reach of mortal souls, beyond the ether, into black holes?
But sure as there's C, Pascal, Lotus, Ashton-Tate and more,
You will be one day be left to wander, lost on some Plutonian shore,
Pleading, "Abort, Retry, Ignore?"

                <p>Bill Gates died in a car accident. He found himself in Purgatory being sized up by God...</p>
<p>"Well, Bill, I'm really confused on this call. I'm not sure whether to send you to Heaven or Hell. After all, you enormously helped society by putting a computer in almost every home in the world and yet you created that ghastly Windows 95. I'm going to do something I've never done before. In your case, I'm going to let you decide where you want to go!"</p>
<p>Bill replied, "Well, thanks, God. What's the difference between the two?"</p>
<p>God said, "I'm willing to let you visit both places briefly if it will help you make a decision." "Fine, but where should I go first?" God said, "I'm going to leave that up to you." Bill said, "OK, then, let's try Hell first." So Bill went to Hell.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful, clean, sandy beach with clear waters. There were thousands of beautiful women running around, playing in the water, laughing and frolicking about. The sun was shining and the temperature was perfect. Bill was very pleased. "This is great!" he told God, "If this is Hell, I REALLY want to see Heaven!" "Fine," said God and off they went.</p>
<p>Heaven was a high place in the clouds, with angels drifting about playing harps and singing. It was nice but not as enticing as Hell. Bill thought for a quick minute and rendered his decision. "Hmm, I think I prefer Hell" he told God. "Fine," retorted God, "as you desire." So Bill Gates went to Hell.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, God decided to check up on the late billionaire to see how he was doing in Hell. When God arrived in Hell, he found Bill shackled to a wall, screaming amongst the hot flames in a dark cave. He was being burned and tortured by demons. "How's everything going, Bill?" God asked.</p>
<p>Bill responded - his voice full of anguish and disappointment, "This is awful, this is not what I expected. I can't believe this happened. What happened to that other place with the beaches and the beautiful women playing in the water?"</p>
<p>God says, "That was the screen saver". </p>

                <p><strong>Roshan D'Mello (QA Tester)<br />
Developer (Mukesh Thakur)</strong> </p>
<p>Roshan D'Mello:  Hey Mukesh, there is a bug in your code. Type a text in</p>
<p>username text box and press enter. Beep sound doesn't appear.</p>
<p>Mukesh Thakur:  How can that be a bug? There is no requirement that beep</p>
<p>sound should come. Anyway, I will assign it to offshore and get it</p>
<p>fixed.</p>
<p>After 2 days,</p>
<p>Mukesh Thakur : Roshan, bug is fixed. Please verify.</p>
<p>After another 2 days,</p>
<p>Roshan D'Mello :  I have re-opened the bug because sound is not coming in</p>
<p>some PCs. Sound is coming in my machine, but my colleague Rajat Choudhry</p>
<p>is not getting the sound.</p>
<p>After another 2 days,</p>
<p>Mukesh Thakur : Not a bug. I observed that your friend Rajat Choudhry has</p>
<p>Old IBM machine. Unlike your DELL machine, IBM machines do not have inbuilt</p>
<p>speakers. So, to hear the sound in Rajat Choudhry's machine, please use</p>
<p>head phones and then get the bug closed soon.</p>
<p>Another 2 days,</p>
<p>Roshan D'Mello :  I have re-opened the bug because sound tone is</p>
<p>Different across different machines. Sound is coming as 'BEEP' in my machine, but</p>
<p>My colleague Rajat Choudhry who is having IBM machine is getting the sound</p>
<p>as 'TONG'.</p>
<p>Mukesh Thakur : Not a bug. Get lost man. What can we do for the bug? The</p>
<p>Two machines are built in such a way that they produce different sounds. Do</p>
<p>You expect the developers to rebuild the IBM processors to make them</p>
<p>uniform?</p>
<p>Please close it.</p>
<p>Another 2 days,</p>
<p>Roshan D'Mello :  I have re-opened the bug because intensity of beep</p>
<p>Sound produced on 2 different DELL machines is different. My machine produces</p>
<p>Beep sound of intensity 10 decibels whereas my friend's machine produces</p>
<p>Sound worth 20 decibels. Fix your code to make the sound uniform across all</p>
<p>machines.</p>
<p>Another 2 days later,</p>
<p>Mukesh Thakur :  Once again it is not a bug. I have noticed that the</p>
<p>Volume set is different on the two machines. Ensure that volume is same in both</p>
<p>The machines before I get mad and then close the bug.</p>
<p>Another 2 days,</p>
<p>Roshan D'Mello :  I have re-opened the bug.</p>
<p>Mukesh Thakur :  What ?? Why? What more stupid reasons can be there for</p>
<p>re-opening?</p>
<p>Roshan D'Mello:  Sound intensity is different for machines placed at</p>
<p>different locations (different buildings). So, I have re-opened it.</p>
<p>After 2 days,</p>
<p>Mukesh Thakur : I have made some scientists do an acoustical analysis of</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>two buildings you used for testing. They have observed that the</p>
<p>acoustics in the two buildings varies to a large extent. That is why sound intensity</p>
<p>is different across the 2 buildings. So, I beg you to please close the</p>
<p>bugs.</p>
<p>After 1 year</p>
<p>Roshan D'Mello :  I am re-opeing the bug. During the year, I requested</p>
<p>The clients to arrange architects to build two buildings with same</p>
<p>Acoustical features, so that I can test it again. Now, when I tested, I found that</p>
<p>intensity of sound still varying. So, I am re-opening the defect.</p>
<p>Mukesh Thakur : GROWLLLL.....I am really mad now. I am sure that the</p>
<p>Sound waves of the two buildings are getting distorted due to some background</p>
<p>noice or something. Now I need to waste time to prove that it is because</p>
<p>of background noice.</p>
<p>Roshan D'Mello :   No need for that. We will put the machines and run</p>
<p>them in vacuum and see.</p>
<p>Mukesh Thakur:   ??</p>

              @Windows programmer: Why?  The rules in the ISO standard (see section 1.9, paragraph 7) say that the value of any operand should only be modified once in a given expression, and that the order of modification side effects is un-specified.  The equation (as originally written) was (C == C++), not (C = C++).  If it were the latter, it would be undefined behavior.  But because there is only one side effect, the behavior should be deterministic.

Regardless, I&#39;ve changed the equation to fit more with the original question (&quot;What&#39;s the <i>difference</i> between...&quot;), but both are legit. - <b> HanClinto</b>

More details are in section 5 paragraph 4, &quot;Furthermore, the prior value shall be accessed only to determine the value to be stored.&quot; Your new expression with a subtraction operator doesn&#39;t fix this problem.

                <p>There were a group of software engineers and a group of project managers going to a conference by train. The managers each bought a ticket for the train, the engineers only bought one ticket for the whole group.</p>
<p>On the train, as the guard came through to check the tickets, the engineers all entered a single toilet. The guard checked the managers' tickets and then knocked on the toilet door,</p>
<p>"Ticket please," the guard asked.</p>
<p>The engineers slipped the ticket under the door, the guard checked it and went on his way. The managers saw this and were impressed.</p>
<p>The following year, the same managers and engineers were again going to the conference. This time the managers purchased only one ticket, but the engineers didn't purchase any tickets at all.</p>
<p>On the train, as the guard approached to check tickets, the managers enter the toilet and waited. </p>
<p>An engineer went to the toilet, knocked, and said,</p>
<p>"Ticket please."</p>

                <p><strong>How to get girls interested in programming</strong></p>
<p>Girls like romantic stuff. My new programming language will supply this in the following way:</p>
<ol>
<li>Each variable can either be masculine or feminine.</li>
<li>Masculine arrays are one-based,
feminine arrays are zero-based (this
is soooo obvious).</li>
<li>In a jagged array, at least 40% of
the subarrays need to be feminine.</li>
<li>If you construct a date by
concatenating a masculine and a
feminine variable, some of the space
allocated for the masculine variable
will be reallocated for the date.</li>
<li>Every 28th cpu cycle, all feminine
variables will throw exceptions or
other heavy objects if queried the
wrong way (what the right and wrong
way is, is undocumented – pending
research)</li>
<li>During communication, feminine
variables will always go through a
named pipe, tcp port or anything
like that before masculine.</li>
<li>If a masculine pointer raises a flag
for the wrong feminine variable, it
is not an exception.</li>
<li>A female binary large object will be
tried but not caught.</li>
<li>Feminine variables will never dump
unless they are grouped.</li>
<li>Feminine variables are not static
 with threads, they change patterns
 every season.</li>
<li>Behind every long masculine integer
 there is a feminine char.</li>
<li>To construct a short, you must
 first concatenate a feminine single
 and a masculine single into a mixed
 gender double, the most significant
 bits of the double will then
 overflow into a short after a
 period of 9×30 cycles. The double
 can spawn several shorts before
 they are either deallocated or
 split into two singles again.</li>
<li>Feminine variables should be
 camelcase.</li>
<li>Masculine variables have their own
 opinion on what the most
 significant bits of feminine
 variables are.</li>
</ol>

                <p>At a recent computer software engineering management course, the participants were given an awkward question to answer:</p>
<p>"If you had just boarded an airliner and discovered that your team of programmers had been responsible for the flight control software, how many of you would disembark immediately?"</p>
<p>Among the ensuing forest of raised hands only one man sat motionless. When asked what he would do, he replied that he would be quite content to stay aboard. With his team's software, he said, the plane was unlikely to even taxi as far as the runway, let alone take off. </p>

<p>A software engineer, hardware engineer and company division manager
  were on their way to a meeting in Switzerland. They were driving down
  a steep mountain road when suddenly the brakes failed. The car
  careened out of control, bouncing off guard rails until it ground to a
  halt along the mountainside. The occupants were unhurt, but stuck
  halfway down the mountain in a car with no brakes.</p>
<p>"I know," said the manager. "Let's have a meeting, propose a Vision,
  formulate a Mission Statement, define some Goals, and through a
  process of continuous improvement, find a solution to the Critical
  Problems, and we'll be on our way."</p>
<p>"No," said the hardware engineer. "I've got my Swiss army knife with
  me. I can strip down the car's braking system, isolate the fault, fix
  it, and we'll be on our way."</p>
<p>"Wait," said the software engineer. "Before we do anything, shouldn't
  we push the car back to the top of the mountain and see if it happens
  again?"</p>

<p>I used to remember <em>everything</em> when I was a kid.  I suppose I had an infinite stack.  As I got older, and busier, and tired, my stack size decreased until, 3 children later, it was exactly 1 bit.  (Readers of StackOverflow shouldn't need an explanation.)

                <p>I think a lot of the best jokes come during a dull lecture. In a course I was in where we were doing a fast Poisson solver and during a derivation the teacher said "Something's fishy here", to which I and the professor had a riotous laugh, but everyone was just a little confused. Sometimes they're hilarious when you don't expect them to be. Sometimes it just happens. Just be "up" in your lectures. That's all that matters.</p>

                <p>Not a joke, per se, but just something that I witnessed last week:</p>
<p>I have a slightly ditzy friend who's gotten her CS degree and started working remotely for an outsourcing company. I watched as this conversation unfolded between her and another dude-friend of mine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ditzy: Why doesn't it work?</p>
<p>Dude: Well, you're assigning a new value to an argument you got in the function. That overwrites the old value.</p>
<p>Ditzy: But put that value in using a hex!</p>
<p>Dude: What?</p>
<p>Ditzy: Yeah! I thought it made it more magical!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Turns out she thought that values written in hex are magical and don't take up storage, so that you can store as many of them as you want in a single variable, and the compiler will magically access the value you <em>meant</em> it to.</p>

<p>I'll post the start of the joke, you can read the rest at the URL above...</p>
<p>__</p>
<p>There are four major species of Unix sysadmins:</p>
<p><strong>1. The TECHNICAL THUG</strong>. Usually a systems programmer who has been forced into system administration; writes scripts in a polyglot of the Bourne shell, sed, C, awk, and maybe also perl.</p>
<p><strong>2. The ADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST</strong>. Usually a retentive drone (or rarely, a harridan ex-secretary) who has been forced into system administration.</p>
<p><strong>3. The MANIAC</strong>. Usually an aging cracker who discovered that neither the Mossad nor Cuba are willing to pay a living wage for computer espionage. Fell into system administration; occasionally approaches major competitors with indesp schemes.</p>
<p><strong>4. The IDIOT</strong>. Usually a cretin, morpohodite, or old COBOL programmer selected to be the system administrator by a committee of cretins, morphodites, and old COBOL programmers </p>
<p><em>Situations:</em></p>
<p><strong>1. Low Disk Space</strong></p>
<p>TECHNICAL THUG:
Writes a suite of scripts to monitor disk usage, maintain a database of historic disk usage, predict future disk usage via least squares regression analysis, identify users who are more than a standard deviation over the mean, and send mail to the offending parties. Places script in cron. Disk usage does not change, since disk-hogs, by nature, either ignore script-generated mail, or file it away in triplicate.</p>
<p>ADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST:
Puts disk usage policy in motd. Uses disk quotas. Allows no exceptions, thus crippling development work. Locks accounts that go over quota.</p>
<p>MANIAC:</p>
<pre><code># cd /home
# rm -rf `du -s * | sort -rn | head -1 | awk '{print $2}'`;
</code></pre>
<p>IDIOT:</p>
<pre><code># cd /home
# cat `du -s * | sort -rn | head -1 | awk '{ printf "%s/*\n", $2}'` | compress
</code></pre>
<p><strong>2. Excessive CPU Usage</strong></p>
<p>TECHNICAL THUG:
Writes a suite of scripts to monitor processes, maintain a database of CPU usage, identify processes more than a standard deviation over the norm, and renice offending processes. Places script in cron. Ends up renicing the production database into oblivion, bringing operations to a grinding halt, much to the delight of the xtrek freaks.</p>
<p>ADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST:
Puts CPU usage policy in motd. Uses CPU quotas. Locks accounts that go over quota. Allows no exceptions, thus crippling development work, much to the delight of the xtrek freaks.</p>
<p>MANIAC:</p>
<pre><code># kill -9 `ps -augxww | sort -rn +8 -9 | head -1 | awk '{print $2}'`
</code></pre>
<p>IDIOT:</p>
<pre><code># compress -f `ps -augxww | sort -rn +8 -9 | head -1 | awk '{print $2}'`
</code></pre>
<p><strong>3. New Account Creation</strong></p>
<p>TECHNICAL THUG:
Writes perl script that creates home directory, copies in incomprehensible default environment, and places entries in /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, and /etc/group. (By hand, NOT with passmgmt.) Slaps on setuid bit; tells a nearby secretary to handle new accounts. Usually, said secretary is still dithering over the difference between 'enter' and 'return'; and so, no new accounts are ever created.</p>
<p>ADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST:
Puts new account policy in motd. Since people without accounts cannot read the motd, nobody ever fulfills the bureaucratic requirements; and so, no new accounts are ever created.</p>
<p>MANIAC:
"If you're too stupid to break in and create your own account, I don't want you on the system. We've got too many goddamn sh*t-for-brains a**holes on this box anyway."</p>
<p>IDIOT:</p>
<pre><code># cd /home; mkdir "Bob's home directory"
# echo "Bob Simon:gandalf:0:0::/dev/tty:compress -f" &gt; /etc/passwd
Root Disk Fails
</code></pre>

                <p>This one I know from a friend that studied Automated System at the Polytechnic University in Bucharest.</p>
<p>'A man his robot wake up one morning.
While the robot was preparing breakfast the man couldn't help notice the robot wasn't feeling fine.</p>
<ul>
<li>Man: Are you OK ? What happened ?</li>
<li>Robot: I had a horrible nightmare
last night !</li>
<li>Man: You can dream ?</li>
<li>Robot: I was dreaming away my usual
relaxing dream:

1010001011101010001011001001001010101000101000101
... when all of the sudden:

                <p>Yosefk did three great ones a while back on his <a href="http://www.yosefk.com/blog/the-cardinal-programming-jokes.html" rel="nofollow">
blog
</a>
<sup style="font-size:9px">[1]</sup>. This one's my favorite:</p>
<p>When I tell it, I usually introduce it with "This joke's about programming, but it's also about a plumber"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An airplane lands, and passengers come
  out. One of them notices a guy
  underneath the airplane. As you’d
  guess, the guy is a plumber. The
  plumber touches some lock, and
  immediately gets covered by excrement
  streaming from an opening at the
  bottom of the plane.</p>
<p>The next scene should really be a small piece of pantomime, but I’ll have to get by with words alone. He slowly sweeps his right hand over his left arm, then the left hand over the right arm, and shakes his hands. The Passenger exclaims...</p>
<p><strong>Passenger</strong> (appalled): What on Earth
  makes you keep this job?</p>
<p><strong>Plumber</strong> (proudly): Hey, I’m in the
  aerospace business!</p>

                <p>A programmer on his way home finds a talking frog:
"I'm a magical princess turned into a frog. Kiss me so that I will return to my natural form and we may live happily ever after." 
The programmer picks up the frog, looks at it for a while and then puts it in his pocket. Angrily, the frog starts shouting out of his pocket:
"Why don't you kiss me? Surely you have never met someone as beautiful and rich as a princess before. This is a unique opportunity for you." To which the programmer responds:
"I'm a programmer, what use do I have for a girlfriends? Now a talking frog... that's something else..."</p>

                <p>There was a computer scientist walking down the sidewalk when he noticed a frog hopping up and down in front of him.  When he got close the frog suddenly spoke: "Help me I am a beautiful Princess but I have been turned into a frog by an evil witch!"</p>
<p>The computer scientist picked up the frog and put it in his pocket, then continued his walk to work.</p>
<p>The frog piped up out of his pocket "I am a beautiful Princess and I have wealth and riches.  If you kiss me and break the spell we can be married and you can rule my kingdom." but the computer scientist ignored the frog and continued walking along.</p>
<p>Eventually he reached his lecture hall, and took the frog out of his pocket.  The frog looked at him and asked "I have offered you riches, and my kingdom, and marriage to a beautiful Princess.  Why won't you help me?"</p>
<p>He answered "Well I'm a computer scientist, so I'm not interested in girls, but a Talking Frog is Really Neat!"</p>

<p>Moments later a few faint faces appear behind the glass.</p>

<p>The woman takes out her lipstick and draws on the glass:</p>

<p>The faces dissappear behind the glass and soon reemerge with a large sign that says:</p>

                <p>True story:</p>
<p>We had some very heavy snow a few weeks ago, and when I got in to work I got an email from a coworker:</p>
<p>"in case you have not been watching the news,
the pd is asking people to stay clear
from the peripheral roads unless
completely necessary.</p>
<p>i will be doing just that and recommend you do
the same.</p>
<p>many of those roads are not being plowed
to the point that we are not getting bus
traffic or even garbage collection."</p>
<p>That might have been useful to me had I received the email before I left, but it didn't come in until after I actually arrived at the office.  So I wrote back:</p>
<p>"Meh.  I'll be fine.  I'm a Delphi coder.  A lack of garbage collection has never scared me."</p>

              &quot;NACK&quot; is a &quot;negative acknowledgement&quot;, a very old communications protocol for &quot;I don&#39;t understand&quot;. NACK usually forces a resynchronization or renegotiation between end points. ATM is &quot;Asynchronous Transfer Mode&quot;; a couple of decades ago it was a relatively high-speed packet technology that lost out to other technologies.

<p>They are placed in a room and tied to each their chair. Across from them - approx. 10 meters - sits a beautiful naked woman on a bed. The soldiers haven't seen their wives for months, so as the hours go by, they start to feel desire for the woman.</p>
<p>An enemy officer enters and explains to them:</p>
<p>"If you tell me where your base is located, I will let you go. If you don't, then, for every 5 minutes, I will move your chairs, so you are exactly half as far away from the woman than before".</p>
<p>The mathematician:
"This is unfair! None of us will never reach the woman!"</p>
<p>The physicist:
"For all practical purposes, I will be near enough in 2 hours.."</p>

<p>"...the end of the world as foretold in Revelations , Fire and Brimestone, and the Beast and it's minions had surfaced from the lair under the earth's crust.  Summoned by God Almighty to spread terror and destroy any lasting civilizations, any life that hadn't been worth salvation.  The Beast called to the minions, planning how the world would be undone, communications were written and dispatched around the globe.</p>
<p>From up high, God watched on, noting the detail in the organisation, and was confident that all was to go as planned.</p>
<p>However, days, weeks, months passed, and finally God confronted the Beast.
'Why no progress? Such organisation, yet those who were not salvaged still work the earth! Why do you fail me?'</p>

<p>Shub-Internet
/shuhb in't*r-net/ (MUD, from H. P. Lovecraft's evil fictional deity "Shub-Niggurath", the Black Goat with a Thousand Young) The harsh personification of the Internet, Beast of a Thousand Processes, Eater of Characters, Avatar of Line Noise, and Imp of Call Waiting; the hideous multi-tendriled entity formed of all the manifold connections of the net. A sect of MUDders worships Shub-Internet, sacrificing objects and praying for good connections. To no avail - its purpose is malign and evil, and is the cause of all network slowdown. Often heard as in "Freela casts a tac nuke at Shub-Internet for slowing her down." (A forged response often follows along the lines of: "Shub-Internet gulps down the tac nuke and burps happily.") Also cursed by users of FTP and telnet when the system slows down. The dread name of Shub-Internet is seldom spoken aloud, as it is said that repeating it three times will cause the being to wake, deep within its lair beneath the Pentagon. </p>

<h2>We can't add jokes but seeing as this isn't a joke but a question I am going to add a joke I saw somewhere else but didn't see here.</h2>
<p>A grade school teacher was asking his pupils what their parents did for a living. "Tim, you be first. What does your mother do all day?"
Tim stood up and proudly said, "She's a doctor."
"That's wonderful. How about you, Amy?"
Amy shyly stood up, scuffed her feet and said, "My father is a mailman."
"Thank you, Amy" said the teacher. "What does your parent do, Billy?"
Billy proudly stood up and announced, "My daddy plays piano in a ŵhorehouse."</p>
<p>The teacher was aghast and went to Billy's house and rang the bell. Billy's father answered the door. The teacher explained what his son had said and demanded an explanation. Billy's dad said, "I'm actually a system programmer specializing in TCP/IP communication protocol on UNIX systems. How can I explain a thing like that to a seven-year-old?"</p>
