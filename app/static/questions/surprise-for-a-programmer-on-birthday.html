          <p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>hey everyone! sorry it has taken me so long to post pics. the cake was a HUGE success and he enjoyed every bite. but most of all, he loved the "actionscript birthday message" that graced the top of it! i wanted to thank you all for your suggestions. i have printed them and will make many more "coded" cakes as the holidays go by. i really want to do the heart "equation" for valentines day! i took peter toroks idea and tailored it for andrew's birthday cake (i asked a programmer to help me make it fit on the cake!). needless to say, andrew and all of his programmer buddies got a kick out of it and gobbled up the dark chocolate, peanut butter cake that was underneath all that nerdy icing-y goodness! here is proof:</p>
<p>the cake! </p>

                    @Chuck: In my opinion, a question having a programming flavor does not make it necessarily relevant for the site.  But I honestly don&#39;t care that much; people after me can read the SO FAQ as well as this blog post (<a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/01/stack-overflow-where-we-hate-fun/" rel="nofollow">blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/01/stack-overflow-where-we-hate-fun</a>) and make up their own minds on whether they want to vote to close. - <b> Daniel Lew</b>

                    @Daniel:  This is explicitly intended to be a community-run site.  This means that, within limits, that which is popular is right.  Whether this question should be closed or not depends on one&#39;s definition of &quot;programming-related&quot; (it meets my definition of programming-related) or perhaps &quot;subjective and argumentative&quot; (and I&#39;m not seeing any arguing), so I think it&#39;s reasonable to vote either way. - <b> David Thornley</b>

                    hello again! thank you all for reopening this. i completely understand if you need to close it, in order to comply with your standards here. a huge, heartfelt thanks to all who responded with an idea. i have so many to choose from and will probably make many &quot;coded&quot; cakes as the years pass. and to those of you who think i&#39;m a guy, i&#39;m not! my boyfriend discovered this thread and i had to fess up, so i included a picture of myself (as my avatar). my real name is tania. he knows he&#39;s getting a coded cake, but has no idea which one it&#39;ll be. he loves your ideas and is thrilled that i&#39;m doing this - <b> penelope</b>

                    @Beska You raise a good point.  The rating system of SO is clearly flawed.  I&#39;ve been an periodic poster here, and have both asked and answered a few genuine technical questions.  I have 9 badges.  One of them is a yearling badge.  Now a non-technical female posts a single off topic question and ends up with almost as much rep and more badges literally overnight.  I&#39;m not crying about the size of my e-peen here, but it doesn&#39;t seem right that penelope ends up looking more valuable to the SO community than many knowledgeable and helpful developers.  Is it SO, or do we just need to get out more? - <b> rotard</b>

                    Most programmers have a fatal flaw: overthinking things. The number of times this has been closed and reopened only confirms that fact.

                <p>In combination with these any of these answers, you could put just five candles on the cake.  Light the first two, leave the next two unlit, and then light the last one.  This is the binary representation of 25.  Besides being geeky, it will leave more space on the cake for your writing/drawing too.</p>

              Hi Vicky,
No, I have not seen that flickr posting for recursive QR code cake -- that is hilarious.  I am just interested in the application of QRCodes and my suggestion was completely off the top of my head. - <b> mobibob</b>

                <p>Awww! That's adorable.
There is no code for Happy Birthday, But you could write his age in binary and put a goto before it. It's not real code together, but it gets the message across, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>                                      GOTO
                                     011001
</code></pre>
<p>You can use the windows calculator in expert mode for getting the age into binary with a single click. The above is binary for 25 (since you mentioned he'd turn that in a comment).</p>

                <p>The cake was a HUGE success and he enjoyed every bite. But most of all, he loved the "actionscript birthday message" that graced the top of it! I wanted to thank you all for your suggestions. I have printed them and will make many more "coded" cakes as the holidays go by. I really want to do the heart "equation" for valentines day! I took 
Péter Török's idea and tailored it for Andrew's birthday cake (I asked a programmer to help me make it fit on the cake!). Needless to say, Andrew and all of his programmer buddies got a kick out of it and gobbled up the dark chocolate, peanut butter cake that was underneath all that nerdy icing-y goodness! Here is proof:</p>

              Thank you :) My wife saw your topic here, ordered it at Baskin Robbins (cake with Hokey Pokey ice cream). They failed for 2 times though. First they didn&#39;t get the characters right, the ampersand became an <code>e</code> and the semicolon became a <code>j</code>. In a second attempt they put the semicolon at the wrong line (which has been corrected as you can see at the picture). So, be warned whenever you order a cake with &quot;weird&quot; characters! ;) - <b> BalusC</b>

              Who cares if it is a guy? This is a question plenty of people would probably want to know an answer to. It could easily go the other way of the guy is getting his girlfriend/fiancee/wife a geeky cake. I&#39;d understand the angle if he was faking a girl just to get a bigger reaction. Truth be told, more people are willing to help out women then men, regardless of the social group. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s some study out there about that. - <b> The Jug</b>

              Be careful. Realize that once you enter this loop, there&#39;s no escaping, as nothing inside the loop will ever change &quot;happy&quot; to a non-true value. - <b> Wallacoloo</b>

              it reverse the string. For Example if string is 123 initially it convert into 321. so it will reverse the string yadhtribyppah to happybirthday. The same thing is happening in my other answer but with different reverse logic.  - <b> Adeel</b>

              <code>echo</code> indeed simply prints the string, but note that after the exclamation mark <code>!</code> this is piped (<code>|</code>) into <code>tr</code> which is a tool which takes two strings (like a &#39;translation table&#39; if you will)... - <b> ChristopheD</b>

              @penelope: “the cake is a lie” is a plot detail from a popular video game called “Portal” (the player character is promised cake if she solves the puzzles in the game). If your boyfriend doesn’t know it then this joke is going to be lost on him. - <b> Konrad Rudolph</b>
